#
#  [1] "make bootstrap" can be invoked before 'configure' is run (and in
#      fact, even before it is created, if we are bootstrapping from a
#      freshly-cloned checkout).
#
#  [2] When re-bootstrapping an already configured tree, we must ensure
#      that the automatic remake rules for Makefile and company do not
#      kick in, because the tree might be in an inconsistent state (e.g.,
#      we have just switched from 'maint' to 'master', and have the built
#      'automake' script left from 'maint', but the files 'lib/am/*.am'
#      are from 'master': if 'automake' gets run and uses those files --
#      boom!).
