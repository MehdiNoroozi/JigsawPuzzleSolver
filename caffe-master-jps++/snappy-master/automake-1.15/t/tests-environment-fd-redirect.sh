# Test for a behaviour of 'TESTS_ENVIRONMENT' and 'AM_TESTS_ENVIRONMENT'
# w.r.t. file descriptor redirections which, although undocumented,
# is nonetheless required by Gnulib's 'tests/init.sh' and by coreutils'
# testsuite.
# The checked behaviour is that we can portably do file descriptor
# redirections by placing them at the end of a {AM_,}TESTS_ENVIRONMENT
# definition without a following semicolon.  The need to support this
# is detailedly motivated by coreutils bug#8846:
#   <http://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=8846>
# and the following CC:ed thread on bug-autoconf list:
#   <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-autoconf/2011-06/msg00002.html>
