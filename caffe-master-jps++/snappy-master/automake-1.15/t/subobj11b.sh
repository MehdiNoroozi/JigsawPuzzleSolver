# Test that automake works around a bug of Solaris Make. The bug is the
# following.  If we have a Makefile containg a file inclusion like this:
#   include .//foo.mk
# Solaris make fails with a message like:
#   make: ... can't find '/foo.mk': No such file or directory
#   make: fatal error ... read of include file '/foo.mk' failed
# (even if the file 'foo.mk' exists). The error disappear by collapsing
# the repeated slash '/' characters into a single one.
#
# See also "semantic" sister test 'subobj11a.sh', and related test
# 'subobj11c.sh'.
