# DISABLE_HARD_ERRORS is not defined as a make variable, so that it
# should be possible to define either from the environment or from
# command-line, also when recursive make invocations are involved,
# and also without using the '-e' make flag; this should work also
# for non-GNU make. Moreover, it shouldn't be necessary to define
# DISABLE_HARD_ERRORS to "yes" to really disable hard errors: any
# non-empty value should do.
