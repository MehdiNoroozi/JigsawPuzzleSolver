# print any error message when failing to remove a file (due to e.g.,
# "Permission denied").  And it gets weirder.  On OpenIndiana 11, the
# /bin/sh shell (in many respects a decent POSIX shell) seems to somehow
# "eat" the error message from 'rm' in some situation, although the 'rm'
# utility itself correctly prints it when invoked from (say) 'env' or
# 'bash'.  Yikes.
# We'll cater to these incompatibilities by relaxing a test below if
# a faulty shell or 'rm' program is detected.
