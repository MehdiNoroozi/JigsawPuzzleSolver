# == Description ==
# Suppose you have a library and an ltlibrary in the same
# directory which use the same source:
#
#   libfoo_la_SOURCES = foo.c
#   libbar_a_SOURCES = foo.c
#
# In this case foo.c will be compiled twice but using different
# compilers.  This is a conflict.  In this case the user should
# rename one of the 'foo.o' files.
