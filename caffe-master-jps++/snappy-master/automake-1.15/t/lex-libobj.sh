# Force "no system lex library".  Setting LEXLIB to a non-empty value
# ensures that configure won't search for a "lex library", and simply
# rely on the LEXLIB to provide it, if needed.  So, by setting LEXLIB
# to a blank but non-empty value we can fool configure into thinking
# that no system-level library providing a 'yywrap' function is
# available.  See also discussion on automake bug#11306.
