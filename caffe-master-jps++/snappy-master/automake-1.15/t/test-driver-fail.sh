# Custom test drivers: what happens when a test driver fails?  Well,
# "make check" should at least fail too, and the test-suite.log
# shouldn't be created.  Unfortunately, we cannot truly control also
# the (non-)creation of individual test logs, since those are expected
# to be created by the drivers themselves, and an ill-behaved driver
# (like our dummy one in this test) might leave around a test log even
# in case of internal failures.
