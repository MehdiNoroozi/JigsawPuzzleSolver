# TAP support:
#  - TODO and SKIP directives are case-insensitive
#  - TODO and SKIP directives can be followed optionally by a colon ":"
#    and by an optional explanation.
#  - our driver isn't fooled into recognizing TODO and SKIP directives
#    spuriously
#  - the reasons for TODO and SKIP, if present, are nicely printed in
#    the testsuite progress output
