# Due to how the handling of $(BUILT_SOURCES) is implemented in Automake-NG,
# a recursive make call in the recipe of any $(BUILT_SOURCES) (or of any of
# its prerequisites) might cause an infinite recursion (complete with fork
# bomb, yuck) if not handled correctly.  Verify that this doesn't happen.
# For more background, see:

# Backported to improve coverage of mainline Automake.
