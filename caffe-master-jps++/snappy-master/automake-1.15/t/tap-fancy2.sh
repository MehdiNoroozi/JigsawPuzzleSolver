#   Lines written to standard output matching /^(not )?ok\b/ must be
#   interpreted as test lines. All other lines must not be considered
#   test output.

# Unfortunately, the exact format of TODO and SKIP directives is not as
# clearly described in that manpage; but a simple reverse-engineering of
# the prove(1) utility shows that it is probably given by the perl regex
# /#\s*(TODO|SKIP)\b/.
