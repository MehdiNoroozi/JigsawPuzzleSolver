# Test for automake bug#8365, related to Makefile remake rules.
# The bug is due to subtle timestamp issues and limitations in
# make's behaviour, and is very unlikely to be triggered (we have
# to resort to timestamp edit hacks to consistently expose it); in
# any account, it is nigh to impossible to trigger it by running
# make by hand.  Thus, fixing it would not be worth the hassle, but
# we prefer to keep it exposed anyway.

# Modified configure dependencies must have the same timestamp of
# config.status and Makefile in order to trigger the bug.
# We also re-touch config.status, because "touch -r" can truncate
# timestamps on file systems with sub-second resolutions (see the
# autoconf manual).  Finally, we also sleep before touching, to ensure
# that the (possibly truncated) timestamps of config.status etc. are
# strictly newer than the non-truncated configure timestamp.

# Also, the race condition is triggered only when aclocal, automake
# and aclocal run fast enough to keep the timestamp of the generated
# aclocal.m4, Makefile.in and configure equal to the timestamp of
# Makefile & config.status.  To reproduce this race consistently, we
# need the following hackish wrappers.
