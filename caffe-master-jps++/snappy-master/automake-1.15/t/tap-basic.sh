# Basic TAP support:
#  - LOG_COMPILER support;
#  - basic support for TODO and SKIP directives, and "Bail out!" magic;
#  - testsuite progress output on console;
#  - runtime overriding of TESTS and TEST_LOGS;
#  - correct counts of test results (both in summary and in progress
#    output on console).
# Note that some of the features checked here are checked in other
# test cases too, usually in a more thorough and detailed way.
