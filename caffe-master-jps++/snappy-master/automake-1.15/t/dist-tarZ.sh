# On Cygwin, as of 9/2/2012, 'compress' is provided by sharutils
# and is just a dummy script that is not able to actually compress
# (it can only decompress).  So, check that the 'compress' program
# is actually able to compress input.
# Note that, at least on GNU/Linux, 'compress' does (and is
# documented to) exit with status 2 if the output is larger than
# the input after (attempted) compression; so we need to pass it
# an input that it can actually reduce in size when compressing.
