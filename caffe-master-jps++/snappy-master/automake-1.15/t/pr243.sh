# AM_OUTPUT_DEPENDENCY_COMMANDS doesn't handle
# 'Makefile:Makefile.in:tail.mk' in AC_OUTPUT.
#
# == Report ==
# If configure.ac has something like:
#       AC_OUTPUT(Makefile:Makefile.in:tail.mk)
# then config.status cannot parse the Makefile to build the
# dependency files in the .deps directory.  This is because
# the AM_OUTPUT_DEPENDENCY_COMMANDS macro cannot cope with
# the colon in the CONFIG_FILES variable.
