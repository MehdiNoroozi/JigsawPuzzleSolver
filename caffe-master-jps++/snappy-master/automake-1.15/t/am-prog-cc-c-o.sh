# Check that uses of the obsolescent AM_PROG_CC_C_O macro doesn't
# cause spurious warnings or errors.  Suggested by Eric Blake.

# We need gcc for for two reasons:
#  1. to ensure our C compiler grasps "-c -o" together.
#  2. to be able to later fake a dumb compiler not grasping that
#     (done with 'cc-no-c-o' script below, which required gcc).
