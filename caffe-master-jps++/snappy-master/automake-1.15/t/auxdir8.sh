# Test to make sure AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR works correctly.
# This test tries without an explicit call to AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR;
# the config auxdir should be implicitly defined to '.' since
# the install-sh, mkinstalldirs, etc., scripts are in the top-level
# directory.
# Keep this in sync with sister tests 'auxdir6.sh' and 'auxdir7.sh'.
