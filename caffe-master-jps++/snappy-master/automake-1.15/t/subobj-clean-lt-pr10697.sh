# Removing subdir objects does not cause too much 'rm' invocations.
# Also, if we rename a source file in a subdirectory, the stale
# compiled object corresponding to the old name still gets removed
# by "make mostlyclean".  See automake bug#10697.
# This is the libtool case.  Keep this test in sync with sister test
# 'subobj-clean-pr10697.sh', which deals with the non-libtool case.
