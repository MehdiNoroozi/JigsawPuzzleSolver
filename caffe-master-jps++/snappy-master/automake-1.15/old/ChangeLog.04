	directory while uninstalling DJGPP-style info files.

2004-12-17  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* install-sh: Use `(exit N); exit N', not `(exit N); exit'.
	Otherwise, install-sh could exit with improper exit status when
	exiting via a trapped interrupt.  Thanks to a report from Bob Proulx.

2004-12-14  Akim Demaille  <akim@epita.fr>

	* doc/automake.texi (Options): Englishoes.

2004-12-08  Peter O'Gorman  <peter@pogma.com>
	    Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* lib/Automake/FileUtils.pm (dir_has_case_matching_file,
	reset_dir_cache): New functions.
	* automake.in (handle_dist, require_file_internal): Use them, so
	that CHANGELOG is not confused with ChangeLog on case-insensitive
	case-preserving file systems.
	* tests/hfs.test: New file.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add hfs.test.

2004-12-08  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* lib/mdate-sh: Don't use "set - x`$ls_command /`", as zsh mishandles
	the spaces inside $ls_command.  Problem reported by Loulou Pouchet in
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/autoconf/2004-12/msg00074.html>.
	Don't use "set - x"; plain "set x" is enough, and simplifies debugging.

2004-12-05  Toshio Kuratomi  <toshio@tiki-lounge.com>

	* lib/py-compile: Add --destdir switch to py-compile that takes a
	path argument that is not compiled into the file when byte compiling.
	* lib/am/python.am: Use the new py-compile arguments to not include
	DESTDIR in the byte compiled files.
	* tests/python12.test: Test that DESTDIR won't be byte compiled into
	python files.

2004-12-05  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* doc/automake.texi (Clean): Typo.

	* doc/automake.texi: Use @acindex for Autoconf macros, and @vindex
	for variables (@cvindex was previously used for both).  Separate
	these two indices in the output.  Use @code, @file, and @command
	in @cindex lines wherever appropriate so they render nicely.

2004-12-05  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

	* doc/automake.texi (renamed objects, CVS): Typos.

2004-12-05  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add automake.test.
	Report from Eric Blake.

	* lib/am/progs.am (installcheck-%DIR%PROGRAMS): Run programs with

	input without supporting --help and --version.
	* lib/am/scripts.am (installcheck-%DIR%SCRIPTS): Likewise for scripts.
	* tests/gnits2.test: Change scriptnok.sh to cat its input.
	Report and fix from James Youngman.

2004-11-17  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* aclocal.in (%file_seen): Rename as ...
	(%file_added): ... this, and move it close to add_file(), the only
	function that uses it.

	* aclocal.in (version): Remove initial blank line and reproduce
	the layout of automake --version.  From Art Haas.

	* aclocal.in (%file_type, FT_USER, FT_AUTOMAKE_SYSTEM): New variables.

	files.

	* tests/defs.in (testaclocaldir): New variable.
	* tests/aclocal.test: Use it to fix the test.  Report from
	Patrick Welche.

2004-11-10  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* m4/python.m4 (AM_PATH_PYTHON): Fix the invocation of
	AC_PATH_PROGS to correctly define PYTHON as `:' when no interpreter
	is found (this worked correctly only when a minimal version was
	passed to AM_PATH_PYTHON).  Report from Stepan Kasal.
	(_AM_PYTHON_INTERPRETER_LIST): Define using m4_define_default,
	so we can easily override the list from the test suite.
	* tests/python11.test: New file.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add python11.test.

	* doc/automake.texi (Libtool Modules): Make clearer that -module

	(@system_includes): ... this.
	(@user_includes, @automake_includes): New variables.
	($default_acdir, $default_dirlist): Remove.
	(parse_arguments): Populate @user_includes, @automake_includes, and
	@system_includes instead of filling a unique @dirlist array.
	("MAIN"): Adjust to scan m4 files in @user_includes,
	@automake_includes, and @system_includes.

2004-11-06  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

2004-11-04  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	(parse_arguments): Rewrite using Getopt::Long, call &version, and
	honor -W and --warning.
	($verbose): Remove.
	(trace_used_macros): Do not trace the first arguments of macros
	for which we do not need it.  This caused failures because of
	unexpected newlines in the output.
	* doc/automake.texi (aclocal options): Document -W and --warning.
	* tests/defs.in (ACLOCAL): Always use -Werror, to catch Perl
	warnings about uninitialized variables.

2004-11-03  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* tests/defs.in: Do not distinguish VERBOSE=x from
	VERBOSE=anything_but_x, always turn on shell traces.

	* aclocal.in (write_aclocal): Make sure $map_traced_defs{$m} exists
	before using it.  Suppress a warning observable in test/acloca16.test.
	Report from Ralf Wildenhues.

2004-11-01  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* lib/Automake/XFile.pm (lock): Make sure $ENV{'MAKEFLAGS'} exists
	before inspecting it; this fixes "uninitialized value in
	concatenation" diagnostics when flock fails.
	Report from Gary V. Vaughan.

	* aclocal.in: Use strict and -w.  Declare local variables with `my',
	and get rid of `local'.
	(scan_m4_files, add_macro): Reindent these functions while we are
	at it.

	* lib/config.guess, lib/texinfo.tex: New upstream versions.

	* doc/automake.texi (LIBOBJS): Spelling and grammar corrections
	from Ralf Wildenhues.

2004-10-31  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	(LTLIBOBJ): Rename as ...
	(LTLIBOBJS): ... this.  Link to LIBOBJS, and mention LTALLOCA.

2004-10-25  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* doc/automake.texi: Untabify, tabs in the examples are poorly
	rendered.
	* Makefile.am (maintainer-check): Grep tabs in the manual.

	* tests/comment8.test: Use $MAKE, not make.

2004-10-24  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* tests/distcom3.test: Typo.

2004-10-22  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* doc/automake.texi (Libtool Convenience Libraries): Explain how
	to force the linker selection.

	* lib/install-sh: Fix the dirname emulation to ignore trailing
	slashes, i.e., the direname of `a/b/' is `a', not `a/b/'.  This
	caused `install-sh a/b/' to fail.
	* tests/instsh2.test: Augment.
	Report from Пухальский Юрий Андреевич.

2004-10-21  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* automake.in (get_object_extension): The extension to use is know
	by the caller, and cannot be selected by looking only at the
	target name.  Simplify this function to simply conditionally
	prepend $U to the given extension.
	(handle_programs, handle_libraries, handle_ltlibraries): Hard-code
	the extension to use.  This way Automake won't mistake a program
	named `foo.la' as a libtool library.
	* tests/primary3.test: New file.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add primary3.test.

2004-10-12  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* doc/automake.texi (Install): Link to node Extending for examples.
	(Extending): More comments about install-data-hook vs
	install-exec-hook, and link to Install.

	* configure.ac: Export @am_AUTOCONF@.
	* tests/defs.in (AUTOCONF): Define as @am_AUTOCONF@, not @AUTOCONF@,
	so the test suite runs `autoconf' and not `missing --run autoconf'.
	* tests/missing.test, tests/missing2.test: Arrange for missing
	to be used in front of autoconf even if the user has exported
	AUTOCONF.  This fixes two spurious failures reported by
	Mark D. Baushke.

	* lib/compile: Handle output.obj in addition to output.o.
	* tests/compile.test: Check for this.

2004-10-11  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* doc/automake.texi (Sources): Typo, reported by Karl Berry.

2004-10-10  Kelley Cook  <kcook@gcc.gnu.org>  (tiny change)

	of CPPFLAGS, AM_CPPFLAGS.
	(handle_languages): Fix typo.
	(lang_cppasm_rewrite): New function.

2004-09-29  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* tests/subobj9.test: Adjust regexes after previous patch.

2004-09-28  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* automake.in (handle_languages, define_compiler_variable): Output
	Libtool's --tag= option before --mode=compile, because depcomp use
	--mode=compile as end marker for libtool arguments.
	(define_linker_variable): Likewise before --mode=link, for
	uniformity.
	* tests/pr307.test: Make sure dependency files are updated.  That
	was not the case because depcomp thought `--tag=CC' was the
	compiler to get dependencies from.
	Report from Пухальский Юрий Андреевич.

2004-09-26  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* configure.ac: Require Perl 5.6.
	* lib/Automake/Config.in: Require Perl 5.6 (not done in
	lib/Automake/General.pm because it is shared with Autoconf),
	and use `our' instead of `use vars'.
	* aclocal.in (rel2abs): Remove.
	(scan_configure_dep): Use File::Spec->rel2abs instead.

	* tests/compile.test, tests/instsh2.test, tests/instspc.test: Use
	two consecutive spaces in filename instead of one, to catch mistake
	like `echo $val | ...`.
	* tests/README: Suggest this.
	Suggested by Ralf Wildenhues.

2004-09-25  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	called after this macro.
	* tests/distname.test, tests/subdir5.test, tests/subdir8.test,
	tests/subobj.test, tests/subobj4.test, tests/subobj5.test,
	tests/subobj6.test: Adjust.
	Report from Ralf Wildenhues.

	* lib/Automake/Channels.pm (_print_message): Handle uniq_part with
	arbitrary string.
	* automake.in (lang_c_rewrite): Set uniq_part so that the

	and only once for objects with per-target flags.

	* automake.in (lang_c_rewrite): Print files and locations
	for AM_PROG_CC_C_O errors.
	(handle_single_transform): Pass $var to &$subr so it can

2004-09-10  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>
	    Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* automake.in (lang_c_rewrite): Do not require AM_PROG_CC_C_O for
	libtool objects.
	(handle_single_transform): Pass nonansi_obj to &$subr so
	lang_c_rewrite can distinguish libtool objects.
	* tests/libtool7.test: Use subdir-objects without using AM_PROG_CC_C_O.
	Report from Gary V. Vaughan and Patrick Welche.

2004-09-07  Andreas Schwab  <schwab@suse.de>

	* lib/config.guess, lib/texinfo.tex: New upstream versions.

	For PR automake/433:
	* configure.ac (pkgvdatadir): Define using "$PACKAGE", not "automake".

	Fix PR automake/432:

	* tests/yacc7.test: Check this.

2004-08-08  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* lib/Automake/DisjConditions.pm (new): Precompute 'string' and 'conds'
	in place instead of as a side-effect of calling ->string and ->conds.
	This saves method-lookup time, simplify ->string and ->conds, and
	allows to create the object only when necessary.
	(string, conds): Simplify, now that the result is precomputed.

	* automake.in (%am_file_cache): New hash.

	since the change from 2004-07-11 will make it PHONY.

	* lib/am/distdir.am (distdir): Always use $(DIST_SUBDIRS) now
	that it is always defined.  This is less confusing for users
	reading the generated Makefiles.
	* automake.in (handle_dist): Do not substitute DIST_SUBDIR_NAME.

	* lib/am/texibuild.am (?GENERIC?%SOURCE_SUFFIX%.html,

	* lib/install-sh: Remove support for -b= and -t= options; this
	has been moribund for a decade.
	Add support for -t and -T options (new in coreutils install).
	-c option now does nothing (the default is to copy), for
	compatibility with BSD and coreutils 'install'.
	Fix usage message; it referred to nonexistent variables.
	Don't assume 'lasterr' is unset in environment.
	* tests/instsh2.test: Don't assume that install-sh without -c
	moves (it now copies).  Add tests for new -t and -T options.

2004-06-16  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	For Debian Bug#254372:
	* doc/automake.texi (Invoking aclocal): Rewrite the paragraph

2004-06-10  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	For Debian Bug #251820:

2004-06-03  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	`-V -dryrun'.  icc 8.0 fails on the latter.
	* tests/depcomp5.test: Require depmode=icc for icc 7.x, and
	depmod=gcc otherwise.
	Report from Ralf Wildenhues.

	* lib/am/clean.am (distclean-generic): Do no

	* NEWS: Make clearer that we do not output partial Makefile.ins on
	error.
	Suggested by Akim Demaille.

	* lib/depcomp (tru64) [libtool]: Use $dir$base.o.d instead
	of $dir.libs/$base.o.d.  Libtool 1.5 causes both to be output,
	and we will clean the second automatically during distclean.
	Using the latter and leaving the former as we did before cause
	"files left in build directory" failures during distcheck.
	Suggested by Nicolas Joly.

	* doc/automake.texi (Built sources example): Explain what
	nodist_foo_SOURCES is (not) useful to, and use it in all the
	examples.
	(Tags): Mention nodist_noinst_HEADERS and nodist_prog_SOURCES.
	Suggested by Akim Demaille.

2004-05-23  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* configure.ac, NEWS: Bump version to 1.8c.

	* configure.ac, NEWS: Bump version to 1.8b.

	* m4/tar.m4 (_AM_PROG_TAR) <cpio>: Specify -o and -i option first,

	* tests/defs.in (PATH): Export it.

	* lib/am/multilib.am: Add $(MAKE) comments to multido and
	multiclean lines, to enable parallel make.  Based on a patch
	by Alexandre Oliva applied to newlib on 2003-10-15.

2004-05-22  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* automake.in (scan_autoconf_traces): Trace for LT_SUPPORTED_TAG
	instead of AC_LIBTOOL_TAGS, since that how CVS Libtool has been
	changed.
	* tests/libtool3.test: Do not grep for --tag=CC, since CVS
	Libtool (unlike Libtool 1.5) does not has any CC tag.

	* tests/tar2.test: Skip the test if no pax archiver were found.

	* NEWS: Sync with branch-1-8, and reorganize current entry.

	* automake.in (handle_libraries): Make the diagnostic about

	(handle_libraries, handle_ltlibraries): Suggest a standard
	library name in the diagnostic, to help newcomers.
	* tests/stdlib.test, tests/stdlib2.test: Check for these
	suggestions.

	Check directory names for unportable names.  Shaking the code
	to check this also led to the removal of the no-"/"-in-SUBDIRS
	restriction, and a fix to _do_recursive_traversal.

	* automake.in (check_directory): New function extracted from
	handle_subdirs, and augmented to check for reserved W32/DOS name.
	(check_directories_in_var): New function.
	(handle_subdirs): Call check_directories_in_var.  Doing so also
	suppress the restriction that SUBDIRS should not contain slashes.

	to ensure the argument exists and is safe.
	* doc/automake.texi (Top level): Do not say that src/subdir
	cannot be put in SUBDIRS.
	(Dist): Mention that distdir and top_distdir can be absolute.
	* lib/Automake/Variable.pm (_do_recursive_traversal) Support
	undefined $fun_collect, and fix two bugs introduced with
	skip_ac_subst on 2004-03-07.
	* lib/am/distdir.am (distdir): Use absolute distdir and
	top_distdir when recursing, because we can no longer prepend only
	`..' in case of SUBDIRS with `/'.
	* tests/auxdir4.test, tests/subdir9.test: New files.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add auxdir4.test.
	* tests/cond2.test, tests/subdir7.test: Augment to check location
	in diagnostics.

	cygwin compatibility.
	* tests/yacc6.test (AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR): Likewise.

	* tests/conflnk3.test: Isolate checking for working `test -e' into
	a subshell, to skip this test on broken /bin/sh of solaris.

	* m4/cond.m4 (AM_CONDITIONAL): Double-quote diagnostic.

	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add clean2.test.
	Report from Daniel Jacobowitz.

	* aclocal.in (add_macro): Do not error out on undefined required
	macros.  We are not sure they are really used, and Autoconf
	already diagnoses them.
	(scan_configure_dep): Diagnose missing AM_ macros as warnings rather
	than errors.
	* tests/aclocal3.test, tests/ammissing.test: Adjust to expect a
	warning instead of an error.

	macro, and ensure aclocal works anyway.

	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add acloca17.test and remove error.test.

	Fold a few lines to reduce the output by 5 lines.
	Suggested by Karl Berry.

	* automake.in (parse_arguments, MAIN): Give more precise
	diagnostics when no input file is found.
	* tests/output5.test: Adjust.
	Suggested by Jens Petersen.

	Propagate this $(srcdir) prefix in Automake variables.

2004-05-13  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* Makefile.am (fetch): Work even with FreeBSD "make", which
	uses sh -e and thus errors-out if a simple-command fails.
	* lib/am/check.am (check-TESTS): Likewise.

	* lib/am/tags.am (TAGS): Likewise.

2004-05-13  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* tests/lex3.test, tests/yacc6.test: Require GNU Make.
	Fixing these for BSD Make requires invasive changes (lexers and
	parsers must be built into $srcdir, and--most annoyingly--all
	references to parse.h must be changed to $(srcdir)/parse.h).
	Report from Mark D. Baushke.

	creates the TAGS file anyway.
	Report from Akim Demaille.

	* lib/depcomp (tru64) [libtool]: Nicolas Joly reported on
	2002-06-12 that dependencies were output in $dir.libs/$base.lo.d.

	appropriate.
	(MAIN): Remove the loop on $automake_needs_to_reprocess_all_files.

2004-04-10  Andreas Buening  <andreas.buening@nexgo.de>

	* aclocal.in, automake.in, configure.ac, Makefile.am,
	tests/aclocal.in, tests/automake.in, tests/defs.in:
	Use PATH_SEPARATOR from autoconf instead of ':'.

2004-04-09  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

2004-04-01  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* lib/install-sh: If "mv -f" works, use it, and fall back to
	the old "test -f" + "rm -f" + "mv" method only if "mv -f" does
	not work.  This improves performance in the usual case where
	"mv -f" works.  It also lets us install the "mv" command
	without worrying about a small window where "mv" does not
	exist (this problem was reported by Raul Nunez de Arenas
	Coronado).

2004-03-26  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	so that rules for the same headers are not output twice.

	Fix for PR/413:

	* aclocal.in (rel2abs): New function.

	Report from Miloslav Trmac.

2004-01-22  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* tests/lex5.test: Sleep before calling AUTOMAKE the second time,

2004-01-03  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* automake.in (scan_texinfo_file): Do not compare $outfile to ''

	Adjust.
	Suggested by Tom Tromey.

	Do not output .lo rules for programs and static libraries objects,

	about explicit rules only, not inference rules.
	* automake.in (handle_single_transform_list): Rename as ...
	(handle_single_transform): ... this.  Take a single file
	to transform (it was only called this way) and accept a new

	of these lists.
	(define_objects_from_sources, handle_source_transform):
	Take a %transform argument, and forward it to &handle_single_transform.
