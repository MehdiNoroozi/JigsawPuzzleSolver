	Process the rule twice to handle deansified files in subdirectories.
	Mark _.c files in subdirectories for cleaning.
	(handle_single_transform_list): Append $U to $obj_sans_ext if
	needed: before this dependencies were output foo.Po instead
	of foo$U.Po.  Don't output explicit dependencies for renamed
	objects or sources in sub-directories: we already output
	a full compile rule for them.
	(lang_c_finish): Don't always use the full filename in the
