2009-12-29  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Fix and complete copyright notices in Makefile.am files.
	* Makefile.am: Use single-`#' comment for copyright notice, so
	that it also appears in the generated Makefile.in file.
	* doc/Makefile.am: Likewise.
	* doc/amhello/Makefile.am: Likewise.
	* doc/amhello/src/Makefile.am: Likewise.

	* tests/Makefile.am: Add copyright notice.
	Report of missing copyright notice by Stefano Lattarini.

2009-12-27  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Fixed typo in Makefile.am (extra semicolon removed)
	* Makefile.am (sc_diff_automake_in_automake): Removed an extra
	semicolon in target's rules, which prevented a stdout redirection
	from working.

2009-12-21  Julien Danjou  <julien@danjou.info>  (tiny change)

	Add support for newer python version
	* m4/python.m4 (AM_PATH_PYTHON): Add python3.1 to

	Replace unlzma, gunzip, bunzip2 with pack tool -d invocation.
	* lib/am/distdir.am (distcheck): Use lzma -d, gzip -d, bzip2 -d,
	instead of the respective un$tool invocation, to avoid depending
	on another tool.
	* THANKS: Update.

2009-12-05  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Use $DJDIR rather than $DJGPP to detect running on DJGPP.
	* automake.in (Language): Use $ENV{'DJDIR'} for the
	$ENV{'SHELL'} override.
	* bootstrap: Use $DJDIR for setting BOOTSTRAP_SHELL, to fix
	bootstrapping under MinGW when $DJGPP has been set.

	Do not rely on Perl symlink status, for MSYS perl.
	* automake.in (require_file_internal): Ensure presence of
	symlink target file; MSYS perl symlink doesn't return an error
	status when the file could not be created (copied, on this
	system).  Fixes symlink.test failure.

2009-12-04  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>
	    Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Avoid Solaris sh `set -e' bug in vala4.test.
	* tests/vala4.test: New variable $cwd, holding the full path of the
	current directory.  Use it instead of `pwd` command substitution,
	to avoid Heirloom/Solaris Sh bug with `set -e'.

2009-12-05  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Fix requirements of silent8.test.
	* tests/silent8.test: Require makeinfo --html, tex, texi2dvi -o,
	dvips.

2009-12-04  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	File `automake.in' is not meant to be executed (only to be
	preprocessed into `automake'), so don't leave it executable.
	* automake.in: Remove executable bit.

2009-12-04  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Don't make the generated Automake's Config.pm executable.
	* lib/Automake/Makefile.am (Config.pm): Don't make the generated
	`Config.pm' file executable.

2009-11-28  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	do not put world-writable directories in distribution tarballs
	* lib/am/distdir.am (distdir): Do not make all directories
	group- or world-writable.  Instead, use 755.
	* tests/subpkg4.test (test-distdir-is-readable): Check for new,
	more restricted permissions.

2009-11-29  Karl Berry  <karl@freefriends.org>

	Rewrite `gnupload --help' examples.
	* lib/gnupload: Use GNU style version numbers, a generic package
	name, and more useful examples.

2009-11-28  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	avoid a warning from perl-5.11
	* lib/Automake/Wrap.pm (_tab_length): Remove useless use of tr's
	"/d" modifier.

2009-11-14  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Distribute the Automake bootstrap script.
	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add bootstrap.
	Report by Jan Engelhardt.

2009-11-14  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* tests/Makefile.am: Update.

	Coverage for user-provided _LINK variables.
	* tests/link_override.test: New test.
	* tests/Makefile.am: Adjust.

	Coverage: warn about substitutions that need EXTRA_PRIMARY.
	* tests/extra9.test: New test.

	Coverage for syntax errors with conditionals in included fragments.
	* tests/condinc2.test: Amend test.

	Coverage: diagnose variables with forbidden dist_ prefix.
	* tests/candist.test: New test.
	* tests/Makefile.am: Update.

	Coverage for conditional `else' and `endif' arguments.
	* tests/cond46.test: New test.

2009-10-31  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>
	    Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Don't let an envvar setting of "$fail" cause build failure.
	Without this change, in a project using an automake-generated
	Makefile, "make fail=anything" would fail inappropriately,
	due to the `test -z "$$fail"' at the end of this emitted rule:
	* lib/am/subdirs.am ($(RECURSIVE_TARGETS)): Initialize "fail=" to keep
	an envvar setting of that variable from causing unwarranted failure.
	($(RECURSIVE_CLEAN_TARGETS)): Likewise.
	* tests/subdir10.test: New test.
	* tests/Makefile.am: Update.

2009-10-18  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Simplify Variable::_check_ambiguous_condition.
	* lib/Automake/Variable.pm (_check_ambiguous_condition): No need
	to check for $def since ambiguous_p returns an empty $message if
	there is no other condition which is ambiguous to $cond.

	Coverage for DisjConditions.pm.
	* lib/Automake/tests/DisjConditions.pl (test_basics): Increase
	test coverage: test ->human, ->merge, ->simplify, ->multiply.
	* lib/Automake/tests/DisjConditions-t.pl (test_basics): Likewise
	changes, but including state copies across thread creation.
	* lib/Automake/tests/DisjCon2.pl: New test.
	* lib/Automake/tests/DisjCon3.pl: Likewise.
	* lib/Automake/tests/Makefile.am (TESTS, XFAIL_TESTS): Adjust.

	Coverage and fixes for Condition.pm.
	* lib/Automake/Condition.pm (new): Catch common programming
	errors better by checking type of passed argument before
	munging them to all be strings through split.
	* lib/Automake/tests/Condition.pl (test_basics): Also test
	->human.
	(test_merge): New function, test ->merge, ->merge_conds,
	->strip.
	* lib/Automake/tests/Condition-t.pl (test_basics, test_merge):
	Likewise changes, but including state copies across thread
	creation.
	* lib/Automake/tests/Cond2.pl: New test for programming error.
	* lib/Automake/tests/Cond3.pl: Likewise.
	* lib/Automake/tests/Makefile.am (TESTS, XFAIL_TESTS): Update.

	Coverage for Wrap.pm.
	* lib/Automake/tests/Wrap.pl (@tests): Add test for word with
	trailing space.
	(test_makefile_wrap, @makefile_tests): New function, new list of
	tests, to test makefile_wrap.

	Coverage for Version.pm.
	* lib/Automake/tests/Version.pl (test_version_compare): Also
	try Automake::Version::check for the version pairs, taking into
	account the special-case naming of code forks.
	(@tests): Add more test cases.
	(test_bad_versions, @bad_versions): New function, new test cases,
	to ensure bad version strings are rejected.
	* lib/Automake/tests/Version2.pl: New test.
	* lib/Automake/tests/Version3.pl: Likewise.
	* lib/Automake/tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add tests here ...
	(XFAIL_TESTS): ... and here, new.

	Pod coverage for Perl modules.
	* lib/Automake/ChannelDefs.pm (parse_warnings): Fix
	typo in Pod documentation.
	* lib/Automake/Condition.pm: Add a couple of missing `=back'
	lines.
	(_has): Renamed from ...
	(has): ... this, as this is an internal method.

	* lib/Automake/Configure_ac.pm: Add Pod `Functions' section with
	documentation for find_configure_ac and require_configure_ac.

	* lib/Automake/XFile.pm: Reorganize Pod a bit, add `Methods'
	section.

2009-10-17  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Perl coverage support using Devel::Cover.
	This introduces makefile rules to run the testsuite with Perl
	coverage enabled.  It skips tests that use perl ithreads, by
	unsetting AUTOMAKE_JOBS and setting WANT_NO_THREADS to make the
	threaded tests skip.
	* Makefile.am (PERL_COVERAGE_DB, PERL_COVERAGE_FLAGS)
	(PERL_COVER): New variables.
	(check-coverage, recheck-coverage, clean-coverage): New phony
	targets.
	(check-coverage-run, recheck-coverage-run): New phony helper
	targets.
	(clean-local): New, depend on clean-coverage.
	* lib/Automake/tests/Condition-t.pl: Skip if WANT_NO_THREADS is
	set.
	* lib/Automake/tests/DisjConditions-t.pl: Likewise.
	* tests/defs.in: New required entry 'perl-threads'.
	* tests/parallel-am.test: Use it to skip if WANT_NO_THREADS is
	set.
	* tests/parallel-am2.test: Likewise.
	* tests/parallel-am3.test: Likewise.

	Add convenience `recheck' target to our toplevel Makefile.am.
	* Makefile.am (recheck): New convenience target.
	* tests/README: Give examples for running only failed or
	outdated or otherwise selected tests.

	dist: allow running several compressors in parallel.
	* lib/am/distdir.am (am__post_remove_distdir): New internal
	variable.
	(DIST_TARGETS): New variable, set to list of chosen distribution
	formats.  Order formats by expected duration, slowest first, for
	better parallelism.
	(dist-gzip, dist-bzip2, dist-lzma, dist-xz, dist-tarZ)
	(dist-shar, dist-zip): Use $(am__post_remove_distdir).
	(dist, dist-all): Do not depend on distdir.  Instead of
	replicating each compression command, use a recursive invocation
	to allow running all $(DIST_TARGETS) in parallel.
	* NEWS: Update.
	Report by Peter Breitenlohner.

	Fix license headers of cscope tests to be GPLv2+.
	* tests/cscope.test: Revert to GPL version 2.
	* tests/cscope2.test: Likewise.
	* tests/cscope3.test: Likewise.

	Sync auxiliary files from upstream.
	* INSTALL, lib/INSTALL, lib/config.guess, lib/config.sub,
	lib/texinfo.tex: Sync from upstream.

	Doc and comment typos.
	* automake.in (handle_ltlibraries): Fix typo in comment.
	* tests/distcom7.test: Likewise.
	* tests/lisp5.test: Likewise.
	* doc/automake.texi (Usage of Conditionals): Fix typo.

2009-10-11  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Fix race condition in werror2.test due to sanity sleep change.
	* tests/werror2.test: Generate Makefile.in before configure so
	that a Makefile.am update after configure has run is guaranteed
	to be newer than Makefile.in.
	* tests/subdir5.test: Document why this test does not need to be
	fixed.
	* tests/subdir8.test: Likewise.

	Improve description of the various *LINK variables.
	* doc/automake.texi (Program and Library Variables): _LINK also
	receives libraries to link against.  _LINK may be generated.
	(Program Variables): Document reasons when per-target _LINK is
	used instead of LINK.
	(How the Linker is Chosen): Document how a per-target _LINK
	variable and per-target link flags override linker selection.
	* THANKS: Update.
	Report by Dave Korn against gcc/libstdc++-v3.

	Allow variable override of, rather than by, silent variables.
	When overriding variables, check the VAR_SILENT status of the
	old condition, not the new one: we allow non-silent overrides
	of silent variables (these do not hit ordering bugs in the
	automake output), but there is no use case for doing so the
	other way round.  Fixes conditional overrides of variables
	annotated AM_SUBST_NOTMAKE in configure.ac.
	* lib/Automake/Variable.pm (_check_ambiguous_condition): Check
	for VAR_SILENT in $ambig_cond not $cond.
	* tests/cond44.test, tests/cond45.test: New tests, analogous to
	cond23.test and cond24.test.
	* tests/Makefile.am: Update.
	Spotted originally in binutils/bfd.

	Fix `make clean check' for the Automake package.
	* lib/Automake/Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Add `.' before `tests',
	so that Config.pm is built first.

	Fix in-tree `recheck' after failed test that runs `check'.
	If a test like pr401b-p.test fails for some reason, a `make
	recheck' would cause another reason for failure because it sets
	AM_MAKEFLAGS which gets propagated into the test and causes its
	`make check' to fail.
	* tests/defs.in: Also unset AM_MAKEFLAGS.

2009-10-11  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Updated code enabling Bourne-compatibility in test scripts.
	* tests/defs.in: updated the code enabling Bourne-compatibility
	mode in the shell (now it's copied from autoconf 2.64).

	Avoid leaking TEST_LOG_COMPILER in environment of test scripts.
	* tests/defs.in: Unset variable `TEST_LOG_COMPILER'.

2009-10-07  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Testsuite: do not use `chmod -R' when cleaning up.
	* tests/Makefile.am (clean-local-check): Do not use `chmod -R' on
	the test directories, as that may change or try to change the mode
	of installed files: the test directory may contain symlinks to
	ltmain.sh files from a Libtool installation, and Solaris `chmod -R'
	touches symlink targets.  Instead, use the cleanup strategy used
	in distdir.am (which is also employed in tests/defs.in).

2009-10-06  Bruno Haible  <bruno@clisp.org>
	    Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Fix 'compile' script to not call mv when target equals source.
	* lib/compile: Don't attempt to move the generated file to its
	target destination when it is already at the target destination.
	Avoids an mv failure with subdir-objects.
	* tests/ccnoco3.test: New test.
	* tests/Makefile.am: Adjust.

2009-10-01  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>  (tiny change)

	Fix recommended way to run automake's test scripts with Zsh.
	* tests/README (Supported shells): Changed the recommended way
	to run automake's test scripts with Zsh.  Now we tell to use
	the Zsh's command line option `-o no_function_argzero', not
	`--no-function-argzero', since the latter does not work with
	versions 3.x of Zsh.

2009-09-26  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Fixups and tests for cscope functionality.
	It seems cscope is not able to take into account relative
	file names of included cscope.files files, but it is able to
	canonicalize file names containing '../' sequences.
	This patch makes the cscope references relative again, and
	fixes some corner cases.
	* NEWS: Reword a bit.
	* THANKS: Update.
	* automake.in (handle_tags): Use $(am__cd).  Provide default
	empty rule for the `cscope' target, for empty sources.
	* lib/am/tags.am (cscopelist): Construct relative path to files
	in $(srcdir) if $(srcdir) is relative.
	[TOPDIR_P] (cscope): Do not depend on cscope-clean.  Only invoke
	$(CSCOPE) if cscope.files is nonemtpy.
	(clean-cscope): Rename from ...
	(cscopeclean): ... this.
	(cscope.files): Depend on clean-cscope.
	(distclean-tags) [!TOPDIR_P]: No need to remove cscope files
	here.
	* tests/cscope.test, tests/cscope2.test, tests/cscope3.test: New
	tests.
	* tests/Makefile.am: Adjust.

2009-09-25  Debarshi Ray  <rishi@gnu.org>

	New target to generate cscope database.
	* automake.in (handle_tags): Handle cscope.
	* doc/automake.texi (Tags): Document cscope.
	* lib/am/tags.am (CSCOPE): New macro.
	[TOPDIR_P] (AM_RECURSIVE_TARGETS): Add cscope.
	(cscope): New target.
	(cscopeclean): Likewise.
	(cscope.files): Likewise.
	(cscopelist): Likewise.
	(distclean-tags): Remove `cscope.out', `cscope.in.out',
	`cscope.po.out' and `cscope.files'.
	* NEWS: Update.
	Based upon earlier patch from Jesse Barnes.

2009-09-25  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Use silent-rules for building the Automake package.
	* configure.ac (AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE): Add silent-rules option.
	* Makefile.am (automake, aclocal, INSTALL): Add silencing
	variables to recipe.
	* doc/Makefile.am (update_mans, $(srcdir)/aclocal.1)
	($(srcdir)/automake.1, $(srcdir)/amhello-1.0.tar.gz): Likewise.
	* lib/Automake/Makefile.am (Config.pm): Likewise.
	* tests/Makefile.am ($(srcdir)/parallel-tests.am)
	($(parallel_tests), defs-p): Likewise.

2009-09-25  Jack Kelly  <endgame.dos@gmail.com>

	Add silent rules support for texinfo outputs.
	* automake.in (define_verbose_texinfo): Define several new verbose
	tagvars and verbose vars.
	(define_verbose_tagvar): Increase spacing to 8 to accommodate
	MAKEINFO, TEXI2DVI, TEXI2PDF.
	(handle_texinfo): Additional substitution for silencing dvips.
	(output_texinfo_build_rules): Additional substitutions for
	silencing texi2dvi and texi2pdf.
	* lib/am/texibuild.am: Add silencing to makeinfo, makeinfo --html,
	texi2dvi and texi2pdf rules.
	* lib/am/texinfos.am: Add silencing to .dvi.ps rule.
	* tests/Makefile.am: Add silent8.test.
	* tests/silent8.test: New test: tests that silent texinfo rules
	produce quiet messages.
	* NEWS: Update.

2009-09-18  Peter Johansson  <trojkan@gmail.com>  (tiny change)

	Fix link to "Recursive Make Considered Harmful" paper.
	* doc/automake.texi (Alternative): Fix broken URL.

2009-09-11  Reuben Thomas <rrt@sc3d.org>  (tiny patch)

	Fix outdated reference to sh-utils in the manual.
	* doc/automake.texi (Options): The reference to `sh-utils'
	should be to `coreutils'.

2009-09-06  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Avoid sleeping for one second most of the time in sanity check.
	* m4/sanity.m4 (AM_SANITY_CHECK): Try sanity check first without
	sleeping for a second, and only if that failed, sleep and try
	again, to avoid the delay in the common case of a configure
	script that is older than a second, or a system with sub-second
	time stamp granularity.
	Report and different patch by Jim Meyering.

2009-09-06  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>  (tiny change)

	tests/README: warn about zsh incompatibilities.
	* tests/README (User interface, Getting details from failures):
	Explicitly state that every test is a "shell script", not just
	a "script", and that it's run by `/bin/sh' by default.
	* tests/README (User interface, Supported shells): New subsection,
	telling about expected portability of the automake test scripts,
	describing a zsh incompatibility (w.r.t. $0), and a workaround to
	it (with the `--no-function-argzero' option).

	testsuite: fix a minor glitch.
	* tests/defs.in (exit trap): Use `$me', not `$as_me', as the
	name of the current test (used in error messages).
	* THANKS: Update.

2009-07-08  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	manual: fix a trivial grammar error.
	* doc/automake.texi (Invoking aclocal): Fix grammar.

2009-06-07  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	AM_PROG_GCJ: use AC_CHECK_TOOLS for gcj, for cross compilation.
	* m4/gcj.m4 (AM_PROG_GCJ): Use AC_CHECK_TOOLS, rather than
	AC_CHECK_PROGS, when searching for `gcj'.
	* NEWS: Update.
	Report by Jack Kelly.

2009-05-24  Jack Kelly  <endgame.dos@gmail.com>  (tiny change)
	    Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	AM_PROG_GCJ currently fails to define OBJEXT and EXEEXT.
	* tests/gcj6.test: New test.
	* tests/Makefile.am: Update; mark gcj6.test as XFAIL.
	* THANKS: Update.

2009-05-24  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	parallel-tests: avoid GNU make 3.80 substitution bug.
	* lib/am/check.am [PARALLEL_TESTS] (check-TESTS): Remove any
	`.log' entries from `$(TEST_LOGS)' even if the list is nonempty,
	to work around GNU make 3.80 substitution reference issue with
	trailing white space in the variable.
	* tests/parallel-tests10.test: New test.
	* tests/parallel-tests6.test: Update comment.
	* tests/Makefile.am: Update.
	* NEWS: Update.
	Report by Bob Friesenhahn.

2009-05-23  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	testsuite: unset installation directory variables.
	* tests/defs.in: Before test execution, be sure to unset all
	installation directory variables, so they cannot have an effect
	on a `make -e install' command within a test.
	Report by Dagobert Michelsen.

	testsuite: do not change the mode of installed Libtool files.
	* tests/defs.in: Do not use `chmod -R' on the test directory, as
	that may change or try to change the mode of installed files:
	the test directory may contain symlinks to ltmain.sh files from
	a Libtool installation, and Solaris `chmod -R' touches symlink
	targets.  Instead, use the cleanup strategy used in distdir.am.
	* NEWS: Update.
	Report by Dagobert Michelsen.

	testsuite: do not fail in cleanup code.
	* tests/defs.in: Turn off errexit in the cleanup trap, to avoid
	a test failure due to a nonzero command.
	* THANKS: Update.
	Report by Dagobert Michelsen.

2009-05-23  Peter O'Gorman  <peter@pogma.com>

	python: do not install in system directories on Darwin 9.
	On Darwin 9, get_python_lib returns a path below `/Library/Python'
	regardless of the `prefix' argument it was passed, causing `make
	install' to target the system directories regardless of `--prefix'
	argument used.  Work around this Darwin bug by ignoring the result
	of get_python_lib if it points outside of the passed prefix, and
	the prefix was not a system directory.
	* m4/python.m4 (AM_PATH_PYTHON): If the prefix does not match the
	initial portion of the pythondir returned by get_python_lib, then
	ignore it unless the configured prefix is `/usr' or starts with
	`/System'.  Fixes instmany-python.test failure on Mac OS X 10.5.7.
	* NEWS: Update.

2009-05-23  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Clarify how to enable `silent-rules' and other global options.
	* doc/automake.texi (Options): When introducing options, be more
	careful to note that not all of them can be specified in
	AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS statements, and that some do not make sense in
	subdirectories.  Note more prominently that `silent-rules' can
	only be specified in configure.ac.
	* lib/Automake/Options.pm (_process_option_list): Improve error
	message for `silent-rules', `tar-v7', `tar-ustar', `tar-pax'

	* tests/instmany.test: Likewise.
	Suggestion by Peter O'Gorman.

	Fix test failure when pkg.m4 is not found, only pkg-config.
	* tests/vala5.test: Update comment, this test is not expected to
	fail any more.  Require valac version 0.7.0.  Skip if configure
	fails, could be due to unexpanded PKG_CHECK_MODULES or too old

	Post-release version bump.
	* configure.ac, NEWS: Bump version to 1.11a.

2009-05-17  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Automake 1.11.
	* configure.ac: Bump version to 1.11.
	* doc/automake.texi (Releases): Add line for 1.11.  Remove line
	for 1.10b.

	Fix maintainer-check failures.
	* automake.in (lang_vala_finish_target): Use `$(am__cd)' instead
	of plain `cd'.
	* tests/vala2.test: Use `rm -f' instead of `rm'.

	Revert Automake license to GPLv2+.
	Automake will move to GPLv3+ once the Exception statement has
	been rewritten to use the new GPLv3 exception language.  This
	change does not impact the COPYING file that may be installed
	by `automake --add-missing'.
	* COPYING: Revert to GPLv2.  All uses changed.
	* NEWS: Update.

	Rewrite NEWS for 1.11.
	* NEWS: Rewrite, merging 1.10b and 1.10c entries.

	Sync auxiliary files from upstream.
	* lib/config.guess, lib/config.sub, lib/texinfo.tex: Sync from
	upstream.

	Update release statistics, improve release-stats rule.
	* Makefile.am (release-stats): Output stderr of pstops in
	addition to catching it, for better debugging.
	* doc/automake.texi (Releases): Add line for 1.10.2.

	Cope with parallel BSD make -jN semantics.
	When BSD `make -jN' is used without `-B' which enables backwards
	compatible semantics, it may reuse the same shell for several
	commands within a rule; so ensure we do not leave it in a
	different directory, nor `exit 0' early in a multi-command rule.
	* lib/am/distdir.am (distcheck): After running `distcleancheck',
	change back to original working directory.
	* lib/am/remake-hdr.am (%CONFIG_HIN%): Run autoheader in a
	subshell.
	* lib/am/mans.am (uninstall-man%SECTION%): Do not `exit 0' early
	in a rule that consists of several shell invocations.  Parallel
	NetBSD `make -jN' without `-B' will use only one shell for all
	commands, but won't respawn one after `exit 0'.  Fixes
	notrans.test failure.
	* tests/makej2.test: New test.
	* tests/Makefile.am: Update.

	Fix typo in comment.

	Let AM_PATH_PYTHON honor python's idea about the site directory.
	* m4/python.m4 (AM_PATH_PYTHON): When computing pythondir and
	pyexecdir, pass the expanded prefix resp. exec_prefix as `prefix'
	to get_python_lib, so python can determine the name of the site
	directory depending on the install location.  Afterwards, replace
	the directory names with the unexpanded values of $PYTHON_PREFIX
	resp. $PYTHON_EXEC_PREFIX again, to allow override according to
	the documentation.  Fixes site directory computation for Debian
	and Ubuntu (`dist-packages' for a prefix of `/usr' or `/usr/local',

	GNU make.

2009-05-17  Jürg Billeter  <j@bitron.ch>

	Vala: Use $(srcdir) in rebuild rules.
	valac is always run in srcdir as the generated files are distributed.
	So srcdir needs to be taken into account in the rebuild rules to not
	wrongly trigger a rebuild in the wrong directory.
	* automake.in (lang_vala_finish_target): Rebuild files in
	$(srcdir).
	* tests/vala2.test: Test rebuild rules from VPATH build.

	Vala: Add and test rebuild rules for generated header and vapi files.
	valac will generate additional files when using, for example, -H in
	VALAFLAGS. We need to recognize these options and add appropriate
	rebuild rules to fix parallel build.
	* automake.in (lang_vala_finish_target): Recognize -H, -h,
	--header, --internal-header, --vapi, --internal-api, --gir flags
	to valac and rebuild rules for generated headers; distribute
	and maintainer-clean them.
	* tests/vala2.test: Test rebuild rules.

	Vala: Fix build when using per-target VALAFLAGS.
	This does not yet implement full per-target support for VALAFLAGS,
	however, this change at least fixes building when there is only one
	target per source file, which is the most common situation.
	* automake.in: Remove `VALAFLAGS' from `flags' in language struct.
	(lang_vala_finish_target): Handle `*_VALAFLAGS rewriting' manually
	here; check `VALAFLAGS' user variables.
	* tests/Makefile.am (XFAIL_TESTS): Remove vala5.test.

	* tests/subpkg4.test: New test, to ensure that we still walk the
	whole tree while fixing permissions.  We don't ensure it is
	walked once only.
	* tests/Makefile.am: Update.

	Disable test cleanup trap with OSF1/Tru64 sh.
	* configure.ac: Test whether /bin/sh has working 'set -e'
	in conjunction with an exit trap.  Set $am_cv_sh_errexit_works
	accordingly, substitute sh_errexit_works, and warn about
	leftover test directories with broken shells like Tru64 /bin/sh.
	* tests/defs.in: Do not install any traps with broken shells.

	testsuite: minor w32 fixes.
	* tests/depend5.test: Don't fail if the system or file system

	Report by Bruno Haible.

	Avoid nonportable `./FILE' instead of `FILE' in test.
	* tests/libtool3.test: Do not use `$(top_builddir)/sub/libname.la'
	in *_LDADD entry if `$(top_builddir)' is `.'.  Fixes test failure
	with parallel NetBSD make.

	Detect make `include' style also with parallel non-GNU make.
	Parallel NetBSD make outputs `--- $target ---' messages,
	parallel HP-UX make outputs `Making target"$target"'.  Just
	ignore all additional output for the include test.
	* m4/make.m4 (AM_MAKE_INCLUDE): Ignore additional output

	manual: add FAQ `Debugging Make Rules'.
	* doc/automake.texi (Debugging Make Rules): New FAQ section.
	(Top, FAQ): Adjust menus, and capitalization of the description

	(Multiple Outputs): Add comment to restore font-lock for vim.
	Suggestion by Karl Berry.

	Let XFile::lock warn and fail with parallel non-GNU make, too.

	Fix AM_PROG_VALAC version requirement detection.
	* m4/vala.m4 (AM_PROG_VALAC): Remove `Vala ' from valac

	Fixes failures of vala2.test and vala3.test with older valac.

	Correctly treat all assignments with bogus trailing comments.
	Before this patch, automake would silently fail to diagnose and
	to copy into the output those variable assignments which are
	preceded by a comment, and end in backslash newline comment.
	* automake.in (read_am_file): When determining whether an
	escaped newline followed by a comment is an error, correctly use
	the parser state, not the contents of a saved comment, which
	could still be carried over from a comment before an assignment.

	* tests/nobase.test: Be sure to create a directory before
	creating files in it.  Fixes test failure with MAKE=`make -jN'
	for NetBSD make.  This issue is hidden with parallel GNU make
	due to its parallel breadth first update order.
	* tests/parallel-tests3.test: Skip if $MAKE contains `-j',
	GNU make will use the environment variable $MAKE for recursion
	and thus run in parallel even if `$MAKE -j1' was used on the
	command line in the test.  Also, after running the test proper,

	silent-rules reorganization, --enable-silent-rules switch.
	This patch introduces a configure-time option to set the default
	verbosity.  Since configure now needs to know whether the
	`silent-rules' automake option was set, the latter can only be
	set within AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE, or with a new AM_SILENT_RULES macro
	but not any more through AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS or the automake
	command line option `--silent-rules'.
	* automake.in (define_verbose_var): Define the default verbose
	variable in terms of `$(AM_DEFAULT_VERBOSITY)'.
	(handle_configure): Do not pass `--silent-rules' to automake.
	(scan_autoconf_traces): Trace `AM_SILENT_RULES'.  If seen,
	enable global `silent-rules' option.
	(usage): Do not document `--silent-rules'.
	(parse_arguments): Do not accept `--silent-rules'.
	* doc/automake.texi (Options): Overhaul.  Document
	AM_SILENT_RULES, --enable-silent-rules, --disable-silent-rules,
	AM_DEFAULT_VERBOSITY.  Show an example for user-added variables

	`silent-rules' only as option in configure.ac.
	* m4/init.m4 (AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE): If the `silent-rules' option
	was enabled, require `AM_SILENT_RULES'; move AM_BACKSLASH
	initialization to ...
	* m4/silent.m4 (AM_SILENT_RULES): ... this new file, new macro.
	Deal with `--enable-silent-rules' switch; define
	AM_DEFAULT_VERBOSITY.
	* m4/Makefile.am (dist_m4data_DATA): Add silent.m4.
	* tests/dollarvar.test: Remove tests for `--silent-rules', use
	`AM_SILENT_RULES'.
	* tests/flavor.test: Remove test for `--silent-rules'.

	Test combinations of --enable-silent-rules and
	--disable-silent-rules with `make V=0' and `make V=1'.
	Suggestion for configure-time switch by Bob Friesenhahn.

	manual: Add note about parallelism and tests ordering.

	in parallel.

	Fix maintainer-check failure.
	* tests/suffix13.test: Use Exit not exit.

2009-04-10  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	parallel-tests: more testsuite exposure.
	* tests/parallel-tests.test: Also test overriding TEST_LOGS and
	TESTS.

	parallel-tests: let VERBOSE=yes output appear before summary.
	* lib/am/check.am ($(TEST_SUITE_LOG)): In `VERBOSE=yes' mode,
	output contents of `$(TEST_SUITE_LOG)' before, rather than after
	the test suite summary.  This ensures that the email address
	appears near the end of the output; also, the log file already
	starts with a result summary anyway.

	parallel-tests: `clean recheck' should not rerun all tests.
	* lib/am/check.am (recheck, recheck-html): Do not rerun all

2009-04-07  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Do not remove texinfo outputs upon mostlyclean.
	* lib/am/texinfos.am: New substitutions %MOSTLYCLEAN%,
	%MAINTCLEAN%.
	(clean-aminfo): New target, remove %TEXICLEAN% if nonemtpy,
	declare phony.  Hook this target to ...
	(clean-am): ... this and ...
	(?CYGNUS?clean-info): ... this.
	(maintainer-clean-aminfo): Remove %MAINTCLEAN% if nonempty,
	for later.
	(mostlyclean-aminfo): Remove %MOSTLYCLEAN%.
	* automake.in (handle_texinfo_helper): Return three arrays
	$MOSTLYCLEAN, $TEXICLEAN, $MAINTCLEAN, instead of one array.
	Only put LaTeX helper files in $MOSTLYCLEAN, the rest in
	$TEXICLEAN for now.
	(handle_texinfo): Accept these, chop off extra newline, and
	substitute them in `texinfos.am'.
	* NEWS: Update.
	* tests/txinfo33.test: New test.
	* tests/Makefile.am: Update.
	Report by Bruno Haible.

2009-04-06  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	testsuite: unset TESTS, TEST_LOGS, to avoid interference.
	* tests/defs.in: Unset TESTS, TEST_LOGS.

	testsuite: generate $(parallel_tests) just when needed.
	* tests/Makefile.am (check_SCRIPTS): No need to list
	$(parallel_tests) here, they can be generated as needed during
	the test run, following our recommendation in the manual.

	Remove superfluous line from recheck recheck-html.
	* lib/am/check.am (recheck recheck-html): Remove superfluous
	line, introduced bogusly in last commit.

2009-04-06  Akim Demaille  <akim@lrde.epita.fr>
	    Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	parallel-tests: redo check-html, recheck, recheck-html.
	* lib/am/check.am (recheck, recheck-am): Remove.
	(recheck-TESTS): Rename to ...
	(recheck): ... this and rewrite, factored ...
	(recheck-html): ... with this rule.  Pass TEST_LOGS rather than
	RECHECK_LOGS to `check' and `check-html', respectively, to avoid
	running outdated tests.  Invoking the public macros ensures
	`check_SCRIPTS' etc. are created in time.  Do not output errors
	for tests that were not run yet.  If the testsuite has not run
	at all, run all tests.
	(check-html): Run `check' target, not `check-TESTS', to ensure
	`check_SCRIPTS' etc. are created in time.
	(.PHONY, .MAKE, AM_RECURSIVE_TARGETS): Adjust contents.
	* tests/parallel-tests2.test: Expose the check-html and
	recheck-html issues.
	* tests/parallel-tests9.test: Expose the recheck issues.
	Bugs in previous version pointed out by Akim, who already had
	them fixed in his original version.

2009-04-04  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	parallel-tests: LOG_COMPILER for tests without known extension.
	* automake.in (handle_tests): If we don't match a known
	extension, define `LOG_COMPILER' as `$(LOG_COMPILE)
	$(AM_LOG_FLAGS) $(LOG_FLAGS)' and use it as %COMPILE% in check2.
	* doc/automake.texi (Simple Tests using parallel-tests):
	Document it.  In the examples, suggest using the AM_*LOG_FLAGS
	flags in Makefile.am rather than the variables without `AM_'
	prefix.
	* lib/Automake/tests/Makefile.am (AM_PL_LOG_FLAGS): Renamed from
	(PL_LOG_FLAGS): ... this variable, intended for the user.
	* tests/parallel-tests7.test: Extend test.
	* NEWS: Update.
	Suggestion by Akim Demaille.

	More node renaming in the manual.
	* doc/automake.texi (Top): Adjust menu to ...
	(API Versioning): ... this node being renamed from ...
	(API versioning): ... this, and ...
	(Wildcards): ... this being renamed from ...
	(wildcards): ... this.
	Report by Karl Berry.

2009-04-03  Andreas Schwab  <schwab@linux-m68k.org>

	* tests/instdir-java.test: Don't require gcj.  Skip if javac is
	not available.

2009-04-01  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Fix testsuite failures due to nonexistent `dirlist' entries.
	* tests/defs.in: When parsing `$aclocaldir/dirlist', only add
	existing directories D to aclocal `-I D' flags, as aclocal
	errors on nonexisting directories.
	Report and analysis by Andreas Schwab.

2009-03-31  Akim Demaille  <akim@lrde.epita.fr>

	Fix typo in manual.
	* doc/automake.texi (Simple Tests using parallel-tests): Fix
	typo.

2009-03-31  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	Avoid test failure due to paranoid TAR_OPTIONS envvar setting.
	* tests/txinfo18.test: Don't let a TAR_OPTIONS=--keep-old-files
	environment variable setting cause test failure.  Fixed in
	texi2dvi 4.13.

	Use more common spelling in diagnostic: s/canonic/canonical/.
	* automake.in (check_typos): s/canonic/canonical/.

2009-03-31  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* NEWS: Minor update.

	Reorganize nodes in the manual.
	Avoid texinfo sectioning commands without nodes, by either
	introducing new nodes along with menus, or using headings
	commands.  Adjust all references.
	* doc/automake.texi: Throughout the manual, adjust references to
	new or changed node names.  Rename `non-configured' to

	parallel-tests: New target recheck-html.
	* lib/am/check.am [PARALLEL_TESTS] (recheck-html): New phony,
	recursive target.  Factor common implementation with
	`check-html'.
	* doc/automake.texi (Tests): Document recheck-html.
	* tests/parallel-tests2.test: Test it.

2009-03-28  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>
	    Akim Demaille  <akim@lrde.epita.fr>

	parallel-tests: redo lazy checking: recheck and RECHECK_LOGS.
	Replace the LAZY_TEST_SUITE API with a simpler yet more powerful
	one: RECHECK_LOGS specifies those tests which are to be removed
	in any case before testing.  Provide a `recheck' convenience
	target to set RECHECK_LOGS to all failed and unexpectedly passed
	tests.  Document several ways to limit the set of tests run.
	* lib/am/check.am [PARALLEL_TESTS] (RECHECK_LOGS): New variable,
	default to $(TESTS_LOGS).
	(check-TESTS): Remove $(RECHECK_LOGS) not $(TEST_LOGS).  Drop use
	of LAZY_TEST_SUITE.
	($(TEST_SUITE_LOG)): Do not output note about lazy rerun, as
	LAZY_TEST_SUITE is gone.
	(recheck): New target.
	(recheck-am, recheck-TESTS): New internal targets.
	* doc/automake.texi (Tests): Update @vindex for TESTS and
	TEST_LOGS.  Replace description of LAZY_TEST_SUITE with a list
	of ways the set of tests to be run can be modified.  Document
	RECHECK_LOGS and the recheck target.
	* tests/defs.in: Unset RECHECK_LOGS not LAZY_TEST_SUITE.
	* tests/parallel-tests.test: Adjust, replacing LAZY_TEST_SUITE
	with corresponding RECHECK_LOGS settings.
	* tests/parallel-tests9.test: New tests.
	* tests/Makefile.am: Update.
	Suggestion and different implementation by Akim Demaille.

	parallel-tests: do not mark check-TESTS as `.MAKE'.
	* lib/am/check.am [PARALLEL_TESTS] (.MAKE): Remove check-TESTS.
	This rule removes files, which should not be executed with BSD
	`make -n'.

	parallel-tests: warn about $(srcdir), $(top_srcdir) in TESTS.
	* automake.in (handle_tests): Warn about portability issue
	concerning generated TESTS files listed with a `$(srcdir)/'
	or `$(top_srcdir)/' prefix.
	* doc/automake.texi (TESTS): Document this issue.  Mention that
	the parallel-tests driver is still experimental.
	* tests/parallel-tests8.test: New test.
	* tests/Makefile.am: Update.

	check-html: Always create HTML output, note conversion failure.
	* lib/am/check.am (check-html): Create `$(TEST_SUITE_HTML)' in
	any case.  Exit unsuccessfully if HTML creation failed.
	* tests/parallel-tests2.test: Amend test to expose this.

2009-03-24  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	parallel-tests: per-extension test driver: <EXT>_LOG_COMPILER.
	For test files with extension <ext>, introduce the internal
	variable <EXT>_LOG_COMPILE, which expands to
	$(<EXT>_LOG_COMPILER) $(AM_<EXT>_LOG_FLAGS) $(<EXT>_LOG_FLAGS).
	Turn also the lib/Automake/tests testsuite over to the new
	test driver.
	* doc/automake.texi (Tests): Document `EXT_LOG_COMPILER' and
	`EXT_LOG_FLAGS'.
	* lib/am/check2.am: Insert `%COMPILE%' right before test.
	* automake.in (handle_tests): Substitute `COMPILE' for check2,
	empty for tests without extension, and `$(ext_LOG_COMPILE)' for
	extension `ext'.  In the latter case, define it from the public
	components.
	* configure.ac (AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE): Use `parallel-test' globally.
	* tests/Makefile.am (AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS): Remove, not needed here
	any more.
	* lib/Automake/tests/Makefile.am (TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Split ...
	(PL_LOG_COMPILER, PL_LOG_FLAGS): ... into these new variables.
	(TESTS_EXTENSIONS): New variable, initialize to `.pl'.
	* tests/parallel-tests7.test: New test.
	* tests/Makefile.am: Update.
	Suggestion by Akim Demaille.

2009-03-22  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	parallel-tests: also record logs of SKIPped tests.
	* lib/am/check.am [PARALLEL_TESTS] ($(TEST_SUITE_LOG)): Record
	SKIPs as well.
	Suggested by Jim Meyering.

	Minor optimization in parallel-tests text box creation.
	* lib/am/check.am [PARALLEL-TESTS] (am__text_box): Use only one
	awk invocation, rather than several tools, to create a text box.
	Suggestion from Akim Demaille.

2009-03-29  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Rewrite maintainer-check in separate tests, parallelizable.

	(sc_tests_plain_egrep_fgrep, sc_mkdir_p, sc_perl_at_substs)
	(sc_unquoted_DESTDIR, sc_tabs_in_texi, sc_at_in_texi): New rules,
	all phony, all listed in ...
	(syntax_check_rules): ... this new variable and split out from ...
	(maintainer-check): ... this rule.  Depend on $(syntax_check_rules).

	* Makefile.am (maintainer-check): Do not complain if DESTDIR is
	passed as argument to `make'.

	* doc/automake.texi (Cross-Compilation): Fix underfull hbox.

	lib/texinfo.tex: Sync from upstream.

2009-03-28  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	manual: minor cleanups.
	* doc/automake.texi (Yacc and Lex): Adjust spacing in example.
	(Mixing Fortran 77 With C and C++): Drop unneeded @page breaks.

	Sane (un)install for empty directory variables.
	This patch fixes all install and uninstall rules to behave
	sanely when $(wheredir) is the empty string, but $(where_HOW) is
	nonempty, for all kinds of values of `where' and `HOW'.
	* lib/am/data.am (install-%DIR%%PRIMARY%, uninstall-%DIR%%PRIMARY%):
	Do not touch the install tree if the corresponding directory variable
	$(%NDIR%dir) is empty.
	* lib/am/java.am (install-%DIR%JAVA, uninstall-%DIR%JAVA): Likewise.
	* lib/am/libs.am (install-%DIR%LIBRARIES, uninstall-%DIR%LIBRARIES):

	tests/instdir-texi.test: New tests.
	* tests/Makefile.am: Update.
	* NEWS: Update.
	Suggestion by Akim Demaille.

	Ensure that empty directory variables work with empty content variables.
	This test ensures that, if both $(wheredir) and $(where_HOW) are
	the empty string, then the `install' and `uninstall' rules behave
	sanely, for several directory variables `wheredir' and several
	primaries `HOW'.
	* tests/instdir.test: New test.
	* tests/Makefile.am: Update.

2009-03-23  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* tests/fort5.test: Grep for the tag.
	* THANKS: Update.
	Report by John R. Cary.

2009-03-22  Peter Breitenlohner  <peb@mppmu.mpg.de>
	    Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	For PR automake/533:
	DISTFILES containing a directory and files in that directory.
	When the source tree contains non-writable files or directories
	(as happens during distcheck), and directories or entries
	thereof are listed multiple times in variables to be
	distributed, then the corresponding directories below $(distdir)
	need to be made writable recursively.  Since file modes should
	not change, they need to be copied recursively using `cp -f'.
	* lib/am/distdir.am: Handle this situation.
	* tests/distdir.test: Extend test to those cases.
	* NEWS: Update.
	Report by Peter Breitenlohner.

2009-03-22  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	Fix a documentation typo.
	* doc/automake.texi (Headers): Clarify the note telling when it's
	better not to use noinst_HEADERS.

2009-03-22  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Define AM_RECURSIVE_TARGETS, for gnulib's GNUmakefile.
	This new macro lists all public targets which invoke `make'
	recursively, or depend on targets which do so.  It allows to
	prevent parallelism selectively, when multiple targets are
	passed on the `make' command line.
	* lib/am/distdir.am [%?SUBDIRS%] (AM_RECURSIVE_TARGETS): New
	macro.
	* lib/am/subdirs.am (AM_RECURSIVE_TARGETS): Likewise.
	* lib/am/tags.am [%?SUBDIRS%] (AM_RECURSIVE_TARGETS):
	Likewise.

2009-03-11  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Fix LAZY_TEST_SUITE handling and $(TEST_SUITE_LOG) recreation.
	* lib/am/check.am (check-TESTS): Expand `$(TEST_LOGS)' only once
	in the rule command, for systems with low command line limits.
	Remove $(TEST_SUITE_LOG) even in LAZY_TEST_SUITE mode.
	($(TEST_SUITE_LOG)): Always recreate $(TEST_SUITE_LOG).  Mention
	lazy mode in the summary output.
	* tests/parallel-tests.test: Test LAZY_TEST_SUITE semantics.

2009-03-10  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Fix parallel-tests with empty $(TESTS) for BSD make.
	* lib/am/check.am [PARALLEL_TESTS] ($(TEST_SUITE_LOG)): Ignore
	empty line stemming from empty $(TEST_LOGS), to avoid counting
	zero tests as one.
	(check-TESTS): If `$(TESTS)' is empty, override TEST_LOGS to be
	empty, rather than `.log', for BSD make.
	* tests/parallel-tests6.test: New test.
	* tests/Makefile.am: Update.

	Mark check-html and check-TESTS as recursive for BSD make.
	* lib/am/check.am [PARALLEL_TESTS] (.MAKE): Add check-TESTS
	and check-html prerequisites.

	Match XFAIL_TESTS correctly with Solaris make.
	* lib/am/check.am [PARALLEL_TESTS]: VPATH rewriting may have
	changed test names, so srcdir needs to be taken into account
	explicitly when checking against the list of tests expected
	to fail.  Fixes spurious FAILures from XFAIL_TESTS.

	Use append mode to capture parallel test output.
	* tests/lisp8.test: Use append mode for output from `make -j',
	to avoid dropped lines.
	* tests/parallel-tests3.test: Likewise.

	parallel-tests: Fix summary output.
	* lib/am/check.am (am__text_box): Fix unportable sed script,
	replacing `\n' in the right hand side of an `s' command with
	a literal newline.  Kudos to Bruno Haible for the newline idea.
	* tests/parallel-tests.test: Update test to expose this.

2009-03-08  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Overhaul of tests/README.
	* tests/README: General overhaul.  Mention parallel test suite
	execution, the test-suite.log file; document `Exit' vs. `exit',
	`defs' vs. `defs-p', the naming of `parallel-tests' tests.
	* README: Simplify, point to tests/README.

	Documentation for the parallel-tests driver.
	* doc/automake.texi (Tests, Options): Document the `parallel-tests'
	option, including new features of the test driver.
	* NEWS: Update.

	New tests for `parallel-tests'.
	* tests/parallel-tests.test: New file, to expose a bunch of
	features of `parallel-tests': VERBOSE, clean, TEST_SUITE_LOG,
	test dependencies, DISABLE_HARD_ERRORS.
	* tests/parallel-tests2.test: New file, test check-html.
	* tests/parallel-tests3.test: New file, test concurrency.
	* tests/parallel-tests4.test: New file, test suffix rules.
	* tests/parallel-tests5.test: New file, demonstrate compile/test
	concurrency.
	* tests/defs.in: Add a `required' check for rst2html.
	* tests/Makefile.am: Update.

	parallel-tests: Ensure backward-compatible semantics.
	For each test in Automake's test suite that uses TESTS, generate
	an identical one that uses the `parallel-tests' option, for
	coverage of backward-compatible functionality.
	* tests/gen-parallel-tests: New file, generates distributed
	Makefile.am snippet tests/parallel-tests.am to list all tests
	that use the TESTS interface but not yet the `parallel-tests'
	option, with names mangled to use suffix `-p.test', in ...
	(parallel_tests): ... this new make macro.
	* tests/Makefile.am ($(srcdir)/parallel-tests.am)
	($(parallel_tests), defs-p): New rules.
	(TESTS): Add check11.test and $(parallel_tests).
	(check_SCRIPTS): Add defs-p, $(parallel_tests).
	(check-clean-local): Remove `defs-p'.
	(EXTRA_DIST): Distribute gen-parallel-tests.
	(MAINTAINERCLEANFILES): New variable, remove $(parallel_tests).
	* bootstrap: Generate parallel-tests.am.
	* tests/check8.test: Check for circular dependencies in rules.
	* tests/check11.test: New test, check that SKIPs are not counted
	as passed tests.
	* tests/defs.in: Unset DISABLE_HARD_ERRORS, LAZY_TEST_SUITE,
	VERBOSE, so the tests are not influenced by the way our test
	suite is invoked.

	    Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Parallel test execution: new option `parallel-tests'.
	* automake.in (handle_tests): Set new conditional PARALLEL_TESTS
	when reading check.am.  Handle option `parallel-tests' and all

	Libtool is used.

2009-03-09  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Relax depcomp test for MSVC to not require minuso.
	* m4/depend.m4 (_AM_DEPENDENCIES): When checking the msvisualcpp
	and msvcmsys depmodes, do not require `-c -o' to work just yet.

	[msvcmsys]: New depmode as a derivative of depmode=msvisualcpp.
	msvcmsys transforms any backslashes into forward slashes to

	* THANKS: Update.

2008-12-21  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Revamp semantics for `missing help2man' and manpage distribution.
	Previously, `missing help2man' would create a missing man page
	containing an error message, and exit 1.  This does not play
	well with `make': the next run will see this particular man page
	as being up to date, and will only error out on the next
	generated man page, if any; repeat until all pages are done.
	This patch changes `missing' to exit successfully in this case,
	but `make dist' will ensure that no such man pages are packaged.
	* lib/missing: Exit successfully even if we create a replacement
	page due to missing help2man.
	* automake.in (make_paragraphs): Define %HAVE-MANS% to be true
	if this makefile deals with man pages.
	* lib/am/distdir.am (distdir): If %INSTALL-MAN% and %HAVE-MANS%,
	check that no man page in $(MANS) contains the replacement text
	from `missing'.

	* tests/Makefile.am: Update.
	* NEWS: Reorder a bit, update.
	* THANKS: Update.
	Report by Werner Lemberg and Karl Berry.

	Do not use 'global' for makefile-wide settings.
	* doc/automake.texi (Linking, Libtool Flags)
	(Program and Library Variables, Flag Variables Ordering):
	Reword instances of `global variables' that really mean
	makefile-wide ones.
	* THANKS: Update.
	Report by Andreas Bergmeier.

	Fix config.status depfiles failure.
	* m4/depout.m4 (_AM_OUTPUT_DEPENDENCY_COMMANDS): Commands are
	again a single shell brace group, so they are correctly skipped
	when dependencies are turned off.  The failure is noisy with
	ksh only.
	* tests/depend6.test: New test.
	* tests/Makefile.am: Adjust.
	* THANKS: Update.
	Report and different suggested patch by Markus Duft.

	quoting to MISSING, but only if needed.

	chain used here.
	* tests/parallel-am2.test: Also cope with --add-missing.
	* tests/parallel-am3.test: New test, test absence of races with
	concurrent same-file installs stemming from --add-missing.
	* tests/Makefile.am: Adjust.

	Implement serialization for Locations.
	* lib/Automake/Location.pm (serialize, deserialize): New
	functions.  They allows to serialize a Location in an array, and
	to restore a Location from a thread queue.  The API is
	unsymmetric (array vs. queue) because enqueuing data needs to
	happen atomically.

	Parallel automake: ordered output messages.
	* lib/Automake/Channels.pm (%_default_options): New options
	`ordered' default enabled, `queue', default zero (no queue),
	`queue_key' default undefined.
	(_merge_options): Ensure `ordered' channels cannot have fatal
	messages or backtrace output.
	(_enqueue, _dequeue): New functions, to push messages onto a
	Thread::Queue, and output messages from such a queue, suitably
	weeded for duplicates in the same manner as _print_message.
	(_print_message): If the channel is ordered and has an
	associated queue, then enqueue messages instead of printing
	them.

	to set a Thread::Queue for channels, and to flush a queue.
	* lib/Automake/ChannelDefs.pm: Unset channel option `ordered'
	for fatal, automake, and verb channels.
	* automake.in (QUEUE_MESSAGE): New global constant, used as
	serialization key.
	(handle_makefiles_threaded): Create message queues for each
	input file; workers queue messages, and the master outputs them
	ordered, using the new Channels.pm functions.
	* tests/parallel-am.test: Also check for ordered output (in the
	absence of --add-missing races).
	* tests/parallel-am2.test: New test; check for ordered output of
	warning and (regular) error messages.
	* tests/Makefile.am: Adjust.

	Parallel automake execution: AUTOMAKE_JOBS.
	* lib/Automake/Config.in (perl_threads): New global.
	* automake.in: Use it.  If the perl supports interpreter-based
	threading, then use `threads' and `Thread::Queue'.
	(handle_makefile, handle_makefiles_serial): New functions,
	factored out from main.
	(get_number_of_threads): New function, compute number of threads
	to use, based on environment variable `AUTOMAKE_JOBS' and number
	of independent makefiles.
	(handle_makefiles_threaded): New function.  Spawn threads, use
	thread queue to distribute handling the different makefiles.
	Collect $exit_code values from threads.
	(main): Use new functions.

	5.7.2 and when ithreads are available.

	* Makefile.am (do_subst): Likewise.
	* lib/Automake/Makefile.am (do_subst): Likewise.
	* lib/Automake/ChannelDefs.pm: Use `Automake::Config' and
	`threads'.
	(verb): Prepend thread ID (tid) to verbose messages.
	* lib/Automake/Channels.pm (msg): Before exiting, flush stderr,
	needed for worker threads.
	* lib/Automake/tests/Makefile.am (TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Also
	include the build tree path, so Config.pm is found.
	* tests/parallel-am.test: New test.
	* tests/Makefile.am: Update.
	* doc/automake.texi (Invoking Automake): Document AUTOMAKE_JOBS.
	* NEWS, THANKS: Update.
	Report about long execution times by Joakim Tjernlund and others.

2008-10-26  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Minor file checking optimization: set_dir_cache_file.
	* lib/Automake/FileUtils.pm (set_dir_cache_file): New function.
	* automake.in (require_file_internal): Instead of resetting the
	cache when a file has been installed, simply correct the cache
	using set_dir_cache_file.

	No uniquifying for fatal, prog_error, and verbose messages.
	There is no point in dropping critical messages, even if they
	are duplicates (unlikely to happen unless they have been sent
	as non-critical messages before), and verbose messages should
	enable to show progress, even using duplicate statements.
	* lib/Automake/ChannelDefs.pm (fatal, automake, verb): Set
	`uniq_part' to `UP_NONE' when registering these channels.

	Fix 'config.status --file=... depfiles' with new Autoconf.
	* m4/depout.m4 (_AM_OUTPUT_DEPENDENCY_COMMANDS): Eval
	$CONFIG_STATUS contents if we detect the quoting used by
	Autoconf 2.62 and newer for --file=.
	* tests/depend5.test: New test.
	* tests/Makefile.am: Update.
	* NEWS, THANKS: Update.
	Report by Sam Steingold against gnulib.

2008-10-26  Johan Dahlin  <jdahlin@async.com.br>

	Support for Python 3.0, drop support for pre-2.0.
	* lib/py-compile: Do not import string; use sys.stdout.write
	instead of print, files.split instead of string.split.
	* m4/python.m4 (AM_PATH_PYTHON): Also look for python3 and
	phython3.0; do not look for python1.5.  Use sys.stdout.write.
	(AM_PYTHON_CHECK_VERSION): Do not use string; adjust to xrange
	removal in Python 3.0, and changed semantics of map.
	* doc/automake.texi (Python, Hard-Coded Install Paths): Update
	Python versions mentioned in the manual, using 2.5 everywhere.
	* NEWS, THANKS: Update.

	declarations in the order they will appear in the output.
	($all_target): Unused variable, remove.
	(Variables not reset by &initialize_per_input.): New section,
	clarify that %am_file_cache is not reset.
	(initialize_per_input): Reset $am_file_name, $am_relative_dir,
	$in_file_name, $relative_dir, and $topsrcdir to `undef' rather
	than the empty string; $topsrcdir was not reset at all.  Sort
	remaining variables in the same order as in the section
	`Variables reset by &initialize_per_input'.

	Let stderr output end up on fd 2 in testsuite.
	* tests/defs.in (AUTOMAKE_run): Output recorded stderr on file
	descriptor 2.
	* tests/getopt.test: Fix erroneous multiple redirection,
	uncovered by above change.

2008-10-19  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Fix DisjConditions module to be thread-safe for perl >= 5.7.2.
	Self-hashes of blessed references are not correctly transported
	through thread creation.  This patch fixes that by recreating
	the hashes upon thread creation with a CLONE special subroutine,
	which is automatically invoked by new enough Perl versions.
	* lib/Automake/DisjConditions.pm (CLONE): New special
	subroutine to fix self hashes upon thread creation.
	* lib/Automake/tests/Condition-t.pl: New, sister test to
	Condition.pl, but spawns a new threads after each creation of a
	new condition; skip test if perl is too old or ithreads are not
	available.
	* lib/Automake/tests/DisjConditions-t.pl: Likewise.
	* lib/Automake/tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add them.

	Nicer 'make dist' output.
	* lib/am/distdir.am (distdir): Hide the complex script

	Require texi2dvi in tests, makeinfo may not be enough.
	* tests/txinfo16.test: RHEL 5.2 has makeinfo and texi2dvi in
	separate packages, so also list the latter as required, as the
	test generates DVI and/or PDF output (through distcheck).
	* tests/txinfo18.test: Likewise.

	(Alternative): `nobase_' is not always equivalent to several
	base variables.
	(Install): Mention multi-file install.
	* NEWS: Expand on the issue, list some more user-visible
	consequences.

	Install nobase_lib_LTLIBRARIES before bin_PROGRAMS.
	* automake.in (generate_makefile): If nobase_lib_LTLIBRARIES are
	used, add an ugly hack to install them before bin_PROGRAMS, just
	like done with lib_LTLIBRARIES.
	* tests/ltorder.test: Add program, to expose this.

	Do not reorder nobase ltlib installation.
	This patch changes back the order of installation of nobase
	LTLIBRARIES to that in which files are listed in the variables.
	It does not fix the issue of strict dependency ordering, as
	implied by *_LIBADD, but as before allows to steer the order by
	listing the libraries in nobase_*_LTLIBRARIES appropriately.
	As an advantage over the state of 1.10, multiple consecutive
	nobase libraries to be installed in the same directory are
	passed to libtool in one invocation.
	* lib/am/ltlib.am (install-%DIR%LTLIBRARIES) [!%?BASE%]: Do not
	reorder libraries upon installation.  Remove spurious empty
	line.
	* tests/ltorder.test: New test.

	* automake.in (handle_ltlibraries): New hash %instsubdirs to
	track the dirname of nobase ltlibraries, and tack it onto the
	end of the -rpath argument.  Also, fix the warning about ltlibs
	installed in multiple locations to fit a bit better.
	* tests/pr300-ltlib.test: Expose this bug here.
	* tests/ltinstloc.test: New test.
	* tests/Makefile.am: Update.
	* NEWS: Update.

	Man pages for automake and aclocal.
	* configure.ac (HELP2MAN): New substitution.
	* doc/Makefile.am (dist_man1_MANS, MAINTAINERCLEANFILES)
	(update_mans): New macros.
	($(srcdir)/aclocal-$(APIVERSION).1)
	($(srcdir)/automake-$(APIVERSION).1): New rules, generate
	man pages from the command line help with help2man.
	($(srcdir)/aclocal.1, $(srcdir)/automake.1): New rules, for
	`.so' man page links to the versioned pages.

	more.

	Multi-file install for PROGRAMS.
	* lib/am/progs.am (install-%DIR%PROGRAMS): Allow to install
	several programs with one install invocation, when not using
	libtool; employs some trickery to cater for nobase_, $(EXEEXT),
	create needed directories, libtool, while only forking a
	constant number of times in the fast path; uses awk and sed also
	in the default path.
	(%DIR%PROGRAMS_INSTALL) [!BASE]: No need to use install-sh any
	more.

	Enhance cleaning of programs in libtool mode.
	* lib/am/progs.am (clean-%DIR%PROGRAMS) [?LIBTOOL?]: Fork less
	often, avoid removing programs twice if $(EXEEXT) is empty.
	* tests/nobase-libtool.test: Also test PROGRAMS, in order to

	* tests/instmany.test: New test, for SCRIPTS, DATA, and HEADERS.

	* tests/Makefile.am: Adjust.

2008-09-06  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Fix multi-file installation for files in srcdir.
	For files that can live in the build tree or the source tree,
	we have to expect that prepending `$(srcdir)/' to each name
	will let the install command line exceed length limitations.
	Thus use a new macro, $(am__base_list), to install in chunks
	of 40 files, similar to what we do for nobase_* files.  There,
	lower the limit to 40, too.
	* lib/am/inst-vars.am (am__install_max): Lower to 40.
	(am__base_list): New macro.
	* lib/am/data.am (install-%DIR%%PRIMARY%) [%?BASE%]: Use it.
	* lib/am/texinfos.am (install-dvi-am, install-html-am)
	(install-info-am, install-pdf-am, install-ps-am): Likewise.

2008-09-06  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Use `Exit' instead of `exit' in test suite.
	Cater to Bourne shells like Solaris sh that do not pass the
	`exit' argument as status to the cleanup trap.
	* Makefile.am (maintainer-check): Check that here-documents
	use only `END' or `EOF' as delimiter in the test suite.
	Check that, outside of here-documents, the tests do not use
	`exit' with an argument, but use `Exit' instead.
	* tests/defs.in (Exit): New function.  Use it throughout,
	starting with the introduction of the exit trap.

2008-09-04  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Avoid Heisenbug with verbose testing on HP-UX.
	* tests/output-order.test: Remove spurious redirection line
	from output for comparison.

	For all possibly-relative subdirs, use $(am__cd).
	Up to now, $(am__cd) was only used within backquotes, to avoid
	extraneous output.  This patch also uses it for every `cd' to a
	relative subdir, to prevent CDPATH from entering an unwanted
	directory.
	* Makefile.am (maintainer-check): Fix current check for
	$(am__cd) within backquotes a bit.  Add new check for `cd' to a
	relative subdir.
	* automake.in (handle_tags, handle_configure):  Adjust rules.
	* lib/am/ansi2knr.am: Likewise.
	* lib/am/configure.am: Likewise.
	* lib/am/distdir.am: Likewise.
	* lib/am/remake-hdr.am: Likewise.
	* lib/am/subdirs.am: Likewise.
	* lib/am/tags.am: Likewise.
	* lib/am/texibuild.am: Likewise.

	Fix nobase-python.test for BSD make.
	* tests/nobase-python.test: Listing a dependency to be found
	via VPATH search explicitly, without the path, as a target,
	will turn off VPATH search for FreeBSD make.  So move the
	creation of the files outside of the Makefile.

2008-09-01  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Implement AM_MAINTAINER_MODE([DEFAULT-MODE]).
	* m4/maintainer.m4 (AM_MAINTAINER_MODE): Allow for an optional
	first argument of `enable' or `disable', setting the default.
	* doc/automake.texi (Optional, maintainer-mode): Document.
	* tests/mmode.test: New test.
	* tests/Makefile.am: Adjust.
	* NEWS: Update.
	Suggestion by Vincent Lefevre.

2008-08-31  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Copyright year updates.
	* lib/am/header-vars.am: Update copyright years.
	* lib/am/remake-hdr.am: Likewise.
	* lib/am/tags.am: Likewise.

2008-08-28  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* THANKS: Use Cyrillic name instead of ASCII transcription.

2008-08-22  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Fix rebuilding of removed subdir/Makefile.in files.
	* lib/am/configure.am (%MAKEFILE-IN%) [?!TOPDIR_P?]: If
	subdir/Makefile.in was removed, am--refresh would not update
	it.  Fix up for it by running the per-directory rebuild rule.
	* tests/remake6.test, tests/remake7.test: New tests.
	* tests/Makefile.am: Adjust.
	* NEWS, THANKS: Update.
	Report and initial patch by Ilya N. Golubev.

2008-08-19  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* tests/notrans.test: Use multiple man files of each type.

	Fix maintainer-check failures.
	* doc/automake.texi (Conditionals): Drop TAB.
	* tests/missing6.test: Use 'rm -f'.

2008-08-19  Reuben Thomas <rrt@sc3d.org>  (tiny patch)

	* doc/automake.texi (Flag Variables Ordering, Per-Object Flags):
	Fix grammaros.

2008-08-02  Karl Berry  <karl@freefriends.org>

	* lib/gnupload: Provide also a simple example.

2008-06-25  Thien-Thi Nguyen  <ttn@gnuvola.org>

	Small doc fix.
	* doc/automake.texi (Public Macros): Close open paren.

2008-06-18  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Introduce macro $(am__mv) to facilitate 'libtool --dry-run'.
	* lib/am/depend.am (am__mv): New macro, set to 'mv -f'.
	* lib/am/depend2.am: Use throughout to move the temporary
	depfile *.Tpo to its final destination *.Po.

2008-06-18  Rafael Espindola  <espindola@google.com>

	* lib/config-ml.in: don't handle --enable-shared and --enable-static.

2008-06-18  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* lib/am/inst-vars.am (am__install_max): New variable.
	(am__nobase_list): Use it.

	Fix conditional rules competing with config.status rules.
	* automake.in (handle_configure): Teach targets about the
	conditional config.status rule.
	* tests/cond39.test: Adjust test to expose this.

	For AC_CONFIG_LINKS(X,X), do not clean X in a non-VPATH build.
	* automake.in (rewrite_inputs_into_dependencies): Do distribute
	inputs where input and output name are equal.  This relies on
	the assumption that it only happens with AC_CONFIG_LINKS.
	(handle_configure) <CONFIG_CLEAN_VPATH_FILES>: New variable, for
	links where source and dest are equal.
	* lib/am/clean.am (distclean-generic): Remove, if build tree not
	equal source tree.
	* tests/conflnk4.test: New test.
	* tests/Makefile.am: Adjust.
	* NEWS: Update.

2008-06-06  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* doc/automake.texi (Extending): Fix ambivalent wording.
	Report by Ben Pfaff.

2008-06-04  Karl Berry  <karl@freefriends.org>

	* doc/automake.texi (Install, Hard-Coded Install Paths):  Fix
	punctuation and markup.
	(Extending): Improve wording and clarify order semantics of
	*-local and *-hook targets.

2008-06-01  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* doc/automake.texi (Extending): Fix grammar.
	Report by Karl Berry.

2008-05-13  Stepan Kasal  <skasal@redhat.com>

	Fix typos.
	* doc/automake.texi (Timeline): Reported by Reuben Thomas.
	* lib/am/remake-hdr.am: A few typos in comments.

2008-04-10  Eric Blake  <ebb9@byu.net>

	Prefer a released version of autoconf.
	* NEWS: Bump requirement to autoconf 2.62.
	* m4/init.m4 (AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE): Likewise.
	* configure.ac: Likewise.
	(AC_PREREQ): Remove check, done by AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE instead.

	AC_AUTOCONF_VERSION can inadvertently expand to a macro name.

	Use `install' with multiple files at once for some primaries.
	With nobase targets, at most 50 files are installed at once,
	to avoid quadratic string concatenation and line length limits.
	This isn't yet done with base targets.  One hope is that there,
	the typical file name length is lower.  If this turns out to be
	a problem, it should be revisited.

	* lib/am/inst-vars.am (am__nobase_list): New helper macro for
	installation of multiple nobase files at once: sorts and lists
	files keyed by their target directory.
	* lib/am/data.am (%DIR%%PRIMARY%_INSTALL): No need to set it to
	$(install_sh_DATA) any more, not even for nobase targets.
	(install-%DIR%%PRIMARY%): Split base and nobase cases.
	Rewrite to pass lists of files which all go in the same
	directory to `install'.  In the nobase case, make use of
	$(am__nobase_list) and $(MKDIR_P) each directory before
	populating it.  Take care of files in source and build trees,
	and avoid creating directories where no files are to be
	installed.
	* lib/am/libs.am (%DIR%LIBRARIES_INSTALL): Likewise.
	(install-%DIR%LIBRARIES): Likewise.
	* lib/am/python.am (%DIR%PYTHON_INSTALL): Likewise.

	a list for byte compilation after installation.
	* lib/am/texinfos.am (install-dvi-am, install-html-am)

	to install multiple files at once.
	* NEWS: Update.

	distribute it.
	* tests/txinfo22.test: Ensure TEXINFO_TEX is not distributed.
	* THANKS: Update.

	Abbreviate output a bit by not bothering to quote the .Po file

	lib/am/java.am, lib/am/libs.am, lib/am/lisp.am, lib/am/ltlib.am,
	lib/am/mans.am, lib/am/progs.am, lib/am/python.am,
	lib/am/scripts.am, lib/am/texinfos.am: Use MKDIR_P instead of mkdir_p.
	* m4/mkdirp.m4 (AM_PROG_MKDIR_P): Define mkdir_p using $MKDIR_P, not
	as '$(MKDIR_P)', otherwise it will break `Makefile.in's that use
	mkdir_p without defining MKDIR_P.
	* tests/distdir.test, tests/instman.test, tests/txinfo21.test:
	Adjust.

	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Build lib first, for lib/Automake/Config.pm.
	* configure.ac (ACLOCAL): Use --acdir=m4 in addition to
	-I m4.  Running aclocal during the rebuild rules will fail
	if the default acdir does not exist.

	* NEWS, configure.ac, m4/init.m4, m4/lispdir.m4, m4/mkdirp.m4:
	Require Autoconf 2.60 instead of some intermediate development
	version.

	* doc/automake.texi (Standard Directory Variables): Fix multitable
	width.
	(Autotools Introduction): Fix @uref usage.

2006-08-19  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* doc/automake.texi: Fix some typos in the introduction,
	adjust some spacing; spell `GNU Build System' consistently.

	exhaustive.
	(DESTDIR): Fix example.

2006-08-19  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* doc/automake.texi (Autotools Introduction) New chapter.
	Thanks to Ben Pfaff and Ralf Wildenhues for comments.
	(Auxiliary Programs, Install, Dist, Third-Party Makefiles)
	(distcleancheck): More cross references.
	* doc/amhello/configure.ac, doc/amhello/README,

	(lang_upc_rewrite): New function.
	(resolve_linker): Consider UPCLINK.
	* lib/Automake/Variable.pm (%_ac_macro_for_var): Suggest
	AM_PROG_UPC for UPC and UPCFLAGS.
	* m4/upc.m4: New file.
	* m4/depend.m4 (_AM_DEPENDENCIES): Add UPC case.
	* m4/Makefile.am (dist_m4data_DATA): Add upc.m4.

	Mention UPCFLAGS.
	* tests/upc.test, tests/upc2.test, tests/upc3.test: New file.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add them.
	* tests/ext.test: Also test upc files.

2006-08-04  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* doc/automake.texi (Scripts): Fix some errors in previous patch.

	* doc/automake.texi (Scripts): Revamp.  Show an example of script
	built from configure.ac.  Discuss CLEANFILES and EXTRA_DIST for
	other built scripts.

	* m4/init.m4: Suggest fixing the call to AC_INIT when
	AC_PACKAGE_NAME or AC_PACKAGE_VERSION is undefined.  This is for
	newcomers who call AC_INIT and AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE without arguments.
	* tests/init.test: New file.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add it.

2006-08-04  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

	* automake.in (dist_dirs, fill_dist_dirs): Remove.
	* lib/am/distdir.am (DISTDIRS): Remove.
	* tests/distdir.test, tests/pr2.test: Do not grep, use
	`make distdir' instead.

2006-08-04  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* doc/automake.texi (Conditionals): Split in two sections, "Usage"
	and "Portability", and add a third one, "Limits" to explain how
	conditional definitions inside multi-lines definitions can be
	handled.
	* automake.in (handle_options): Do not assume that
	AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS is defined in TRUE, but diagnose conditional
	definitions of AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS.
	Report from Bas Wijnen.
	* tests/amopt.test: New test.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add it.

	* aclocal.in (install_file): Cannot use /dev/null while diffing
	new files, because Tru64's diff do not handle /dev/null.  So
	create an empty destination file before running diff on a new
	file, and erase it afterward.  Fall back to using /dev/null only
	if we cannot create this file.
	Report and initial patch from Ralf Wildenhues.
	(unlink_tmp): New function.
	* test/acloca18.test: Make sure the empty file has been erased.

2006-08-04  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* automake.in (handle_LIBOBJS_or_ALLOCA): With subdir-objects,
	do not prefix `$(top_builddir)/' aka `./' to nonempty LIBOBJDIR,
	to help BSD Make find the files also in a VPATH build.
	Also return the same path, possibly prefixed, for correct
	depdir computation.
	* tests/pr401.test: Update to expose wrong depdir computation.
	Rewrite to not use the same file name for library object and
	main program.
	* tests/pr401b.test, tests/pr401c.test: Likewise.

2006-07-09  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* lib/install-sh: Don't incorrectly claim that this implementation
	can install only one file at a time.
	(doit_exec): New var, for using 'exec' if possible, to save a process.
	(test_mode, intermediate_mode): Remove.
	(mode): Check for IFS or globbing characters in mode, since they might
	cause weird behavior with the other changes below.  All later uses
	of '"$mode"' changed to '$mode', since the ""s no longer matter.
	Use octal modes if the invoker specifies an octal mode, and use
	octal umask values if 'umask' outputs octal values; this is more
	likely to work with older operating systems since Automake uses
	octal modes, and also works around a bug with HP-UX 11.23
	'mkdir -p -m u=rwx,g=rx,o=rx,u+wx' reported by Ralf Wildenhues in
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-automake/2006-06/msg00024.html>.
	(cp_umask, mkdir_umask): New variables, to avoid
	temporarily creating files or directories with too-permissive modes.
	(mkdir_mode): Use the FreeBSD 'install' method for computing modes of
	intermediate directories; this is safer.
	(posix_mkdir): Also test mkdir -p -m ... by making a directory in
	/tmp and checking the resulting mode with 'ls', to catch a bug in
	HP-UX 11.23 and IRIX 6.5 mkdir reported by Ralf in the same message.
	Use ':' for true, not 'true'; this is a bit faster on
	traditional implementations.

2006-07-09  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	* lib/depcomp: "in in" -> "in" in comment.

2006-07-06  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* tests/defs.in (AUTOMAKE_run): Redirect stdout before stderr,
	for consistency with the recommendation prompted by this report:
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2006-06/msg00225.html>.

2006-06-24  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>
	    Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* m4/mkdirp.m4 (AM_PROG_MKDIR_P): Set `mkdir_p' to
	`'$(MKDIR_P)'', so that it retains the per-directory value
	computed by config.status.
	* lib/am/distdir.am (distdir): do not use `$(mkdir_p)' from
	a changed directory.  Bugs reported by Ralf Menzel.
	* THANKS: Update.

2006-06-24  Eric Dorland  <eric@debian.org>
	    Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* automake.in (scan_texinfo_file): Fix matching file extension.
	* tests/txinfo31.test: New test.
	* tests/Makefile.am: Update.

2006-06-07  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* automake.in (handle_LIBOBJS): Don't rely on the caller defining $1.

2006-06-07  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

	* m4/mkdirp.m4 (AM_PROG_MKDIR_P): Rewrite using AC_PROG_MKDIR_P.

2006-06-06  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>
	    Ralf Wildenhues <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* lib/am/distdir.am: Do not call $(mkdir_p) for each
	distributed file, collect them and create them in one run,
	and strip $(srcdir) and $(top_srcdir) all at once.
	Fix some comment typos.

2006-06-06  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* m4/depend.m4 (_AM_DEPENDENCIES): The IRIX MIPSpro compiler
	7.4.4m may omit the first included header dependency information
	with `-MDupdate'.  Refine test to catch this.

	* configure.ac (ACLOCAL): Use `-I m4' to match `./bootstrap'
	procedure.

	* tests/gettext.test: AM_PROG_GETTEXT of gettext >= 0.14.3
	requires `config.rpath' to be present, and automake now enforces
	this.  Test this, but only if the gettext installation works and
	is recent enough to provide this diagnosis.
	* tests/gettext.test: Provide a dummy `config.rpath' for all
	subsequent checks.
	* tests/gettext2.test, tests/subcond.test: Likewise.

	* tests/pr401.test: Replace "perl -i" with sed and mv, for
	MinGW perl.
	* tests/pr401b.test, tests/pr401c.test, tests/python11.test,
	* tests/yacc6.test, tests/yacc8.test: Likewise.

	* m4/depout.m4 (_AM_OUTPUT_DEPENDENCY_COMMANDS): Do not use
	plain `grep' on the Makefile, as its line length may exceed that
	for grep.  Bug report against coreutils by Sam Sirlin.
	* THANKS: Update.

2006-05-26  Sergey Poznyakoff  <gray@Mirddin.farlep.net>  (tiny change)

	* doc/automake.texi (Options): Add anchor `tar-formats'.

2006-05-25  Noah Misch  <noah@cs.caltech.edu>

	* lib/Automake/XFile.pm (lock): Allow EOPNOTSUPP, besides
	ENOLCK.  Only mention `make -j' when applicable.  Only raise
	fatal errors when `make -j' is involved.  Improve error message.

2006-05-17  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* lib/Automake/Configure_ac.pm (find_configure_ac): Use
	`$configure_in' instead of `configure.in', to preserve
	directory component.
	* lib/Automake/Configure_ac.pm: Add note that Automake owns
	this file.
	* lib/Automake/Channels.pm: Likewise.
	* lib/Automake/FileUtils.pm: Likewise.
	* lib/Automake/Struct.pm: Likewise.

2006-05-16  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* INSTALL, lib/config.guess, lib/config.sub, lib/texinfo.tex:
	New upstream versions.

2006-05-15  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* doc/automake.texi (Auxiliary Programs): Fix URL to GCC
	repository, they use SVN now.

2006-05-13  Werner Lemberg  <wl@gnu.org>

	* lib/gnupload: Add support for savannah.gnu.org and
	savannah.nongnu.org.

2006-05-13  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* lib/Automake/Channels.pm, lib/Automake/Condition.pm,
	lib/Automake/DisjConditions.pm, lib/Automake/Options.pm,
	lib/Automake/VarDef.pm, lib/Automake/Wrap.pm: Fix some typos.

2006-05-11  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* lib/install-sh: Sync from Autoconf, as follows:
	Don't use 'path' to talk about file names,
	as per GNU coding standards.  Close a race condition reported by Ralf
	Wildenhues and Stepan Kasal.  There is still a race condition
	on hosts that predate Posix 1003.1-1992, but we can't help this.
	Don't mishandle weird characters like space on pre-Posix hosts.
	Invoke mkdir at most once per dir arg on pre-Posix hosts.

2006-05-11  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* tests/missing.test, tests/missing2.test: Do not require
	GNUmake.
	* Makefile.am (maintainer-check): Make sure `required=' does not
	follow `. ./defs' in the tests.

	* tests/ansi10.test: Use AC_PROG_CC_STDC.  Fix test that
	ac_cv_prog_cc_stdc isn't just used by Automake code in
	`configure'.
	* tests/ansi6.test, tests/ansi7.test: Likewise.
	* tests/ansi9.test: Likewise.  Do not override by setting
	$U and $(ANSI2KNR) at `make' time; that will be fragile.
	* tests/libobj8.test: Use AC_PROG_CC_STDC.
	* tests/subobj3.test: Likewise.  Use `set -e'.

	* lib/install-sh: Initialize IFS, so field splitting isn't
	turned off later.
	* lib/mkinstalldirs: Likewise.

	* lib/am/java.am (class%DIR%.stamp): Do not assume `$?' has
	the path of the prerequisite added; IRIX 6.5 make does not add
	it, Solaris 2.6 make is inconsistent about adding it.  Fixes
	java.test failure.

	* tests/distdir.test: Do not use leading `./' in EXTRA_DIST for
	files in the source tree.  Fixes failures with HP-UX and Tru64
	make.

	* lib/am/ansi2knr.am (ansi2knr): Rename target as...
	(./ansi2knr): ...this, for BSD make.
	(%ANSI2KNR-DIR%/ansi2knr): Adjust.

2006-05-10  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* tests/depcomp6.test, tests/depcomp7.test: Cater for OpenBSD
	/bin/sh -e issue with failing commands in if clauses.

	* tests/defs.in (Be Bourne compatible): Update from current
	Autoconf.

	* configure.ac: Recommend perl-5.8.2.
	* tests/automake.test: Do not fail because of buggy Getopt::Long
	in perl < 5.8.2.

	* tests/longlin2.test: Do not use `grep' on Makefile.am:
	it has long lines and is thus not a text file; AIX 5.1 grep
	fails to scan non-plain patterns from long lines.

	* tests/overrid.test: Change all regexes for warning messages to
	match after a colon, so that the prepended file names do not
	cause false matches.  Tighten overrides regex.  Fix typo
	`cleam-am-local' -> `clean-am-local'.

	* tests/java.test: `configure' uses a trap, so use `(exit 77);
	exit 77' to portably set the exit status similar to AS_EXIT.
	* tests/fn99.test: propagate nonzero exit status from subshell.

	* tests/mkinst3.test: Fix `mkdir' wrapper to not be confused
	if ``pwd`' contains the string `-p'.  Create the wrapper in a
	subdirectory so that `.' in $PATH does not lead to an endless
	loop.

	* lib/depcomp (ia64hp): Rename dependency style to..
	(hp2): ..this, as it works with aCC on HPPA, too; adjust
	comment.  Report by Olivier Fourdan (PR automake/481).
	* THANKS: Update.

	* tests/aclocal7.test: Add `$sleep's between file touching
	and automake resp aclocal+automake invocations, to ensure
	they complete with a time stamp strictly later than the touched
	file.

	* lib/missing: Remove superfluous quotes.  Replace all uses of
	`[' by `test', for consistency, and for..
	* tests/missing5.test: ..this new test.
	* tests/Makefile.am: Update.

	* lib/missing (sed_minuso, sed_output): New variables.
	(autom4te, help2man, makeinfo): Use them.  Unifies detection of
	`-o FILE', `--output FILE', `--output=FILE', stricter regex.
	Fixes `missing' to detect `--output' for help2man.  Fixes
	PR automake/483.  Report by Dennis J. Linse.
	(autom4te): Document in `missing --help'.
	* THANKS: Update.

2006-04-26  Thien-Thi Nguyen  <ttn@gnu.org>  (tiny change)

	* doc/automake.texi (Dependency Tracking Evolution): Fix typo.

2006-04-24  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* lib/install-sh: Handle --, and diagnose unknown options.
	* m4/mkdirp.m4 (AM_PROG_MKDIR_P): In the normal case, set
	mkdir_p='mkdir -p', not to 'mkdir -p --', for consistency with
	the other ways that mkdir_p might be set.

2006-04-21  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* m4/amversion.in (_AM_AUTOCONF_VERSION): New macro.
	(AM_SET_CURRENT_AUTOMAKE_VERSION): Call it.
	* aclocal.in (trace_used_macros): Trace _AM_AUTOCONF_VERSION.
	(write_aclocal): Output a check for Autoconf's version in aclocal.m4.
	Doing so ensures that users cannot build configure and Makefiles
	with two different autoconf versions.  Report from Noah Misch.
	* tests/missing4.test: New file.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add it.

2006-04-20  Paul Lunau  <temp@lunau.me.uk>  (tiny change)
	    Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* lib/am/dejagnu.am (check-DEJAGNU): Fail when at least one test
	failed, instead of when the last one failed (PR automake/488).
	Report from Paul Lunau.
	* tests/dejagnu4.test: Update to expose this.
	* THANKS: Update.

2006-04-19  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* lib/am/check.am (check-TESTS): Match XFAIL_TESTS delimited by
	TABs as well as spaces.  Fixes PR automake/490.

	* lib/Automake/Variable.pm (%_gen_varname): Fix typos in the
	comment.

2006-04-17  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* m4/lispdir.m4 (AM_PATH_LISPDIR): Require Autoconf 2.59c,

2006-04-10  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

	* NEWS: Fix typo.

2006-04-09  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	adjust scan_configure_dep and scan_file accordingly.
	(scan_configure_dep): Do not search white lines.

2006-01-12  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* lib/am/texinfos.am (dist-info): Tighten glob to avoid unwanted

	(tru64): Typo.

2005-11-01  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

	* lib/install-sh: Use "trap '' 0" instead of "trap - 0", so that

2005-10-17  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

	* doc/automake.texi (Program and Library Variables): Typo.

	* lib/install-sh: Rewrite to support '*' in file names.
	Also, tune so that we don't invoke so many commands in the usual case.
	This has the side effect of fixing `install-sh -d' to not fail if it
	loses the race in creating the last path component against another
	process.
	* tests/instspc.test: The "*" test is now fixed.

2005-09-13  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

	* automake.in (Languages) <cppasm>: Fix typo in the comment.

2005-07-27  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	Suggest reserving -l for third-party libraries.

	* lib/Automake/Variable.pm (require_variables): Mention aclocal's
	search path when suggesting to add a macro in configure.ac.
	People are confused when Automake suggests adding a macro (such as
	AC_PROG_LIBTOOL) that is already in configure.ac.
	* automake.in (require_file_internal): Suggest `automake --add-missing'
	for missing files that can be installed.

	* tests/colon3.test: s/EGREP/FGREP/.

2005-07-19  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* tests/instspc.test: Major rewrite to test for many other
	problematic file names, e.g., '$', '"', '('.  Automake and
	Autoconf can't handle many of them, so do not report a failure
	if the usual candidates show up.

2005-07-19  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

	* Makefile.am (automake, aclocal): Merge the rules.

2005-07-10  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* lib/config.guess, lib/config.sub, lib/texinfo.tex: New upstream
	versions.

2005-07-09  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* lib/install-sh: Use IFS=/ to split directories on /, don't translate
	/ into % as it prevents directory names using %...

2005-07-09  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

	* doc/automake.texi (Public macros): Typo.
	* aclocal.in: Typo in comment.

2005-07-09  Zack Weinberg  <zack@codesourcery.com>  (tiny change)

	ia64 systems).

	* doc/automake.texi (Public macros) <AM_WITH_DMALLOC>: Reword to
	fix an underful hbox.

	New upstream versions.

2005-06-30  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* automake.in (make_paragraphs): Do not define %TOPDIR%, now that
	lib/am/header-vars.am no longer uses it.
	* lib/am/libtool.am (distclean-am, distclean-libtool): Define
	if TOPDIR_P is true, not TOPDIR.
	Suggested by Stepan Kasal.

	* automake.in (read_am_file): Correctly diagnose comments following
	trailing backslash.
	* tests/commen10.test: New file.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add commen10.test.
	Report from Harald Dunkel.

	* automake.in (scan_autoconf_traces): Scan AC_SUBST_TRACE instead
	of AC_SUBST.
	* lib/am/header-vars.am (srcdir, top_srcdir, top_builddir, INSTALL):
	Do not define, they are AC_SUBST_TRACEd by Autoconf.
	* m4/init.m4 (AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE): Require Autoconf 2.59c.
	* tests/include.test: Call AC_OUTPUT.

2005-06-29  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	    Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* lib/mdate-sh: Avoid infinite loop with GNU ls when TIME_STYLE is set.
	* tests/txinfo28.test: Set TIME_STYLE.
	Report from Vincent Lefevre and James Youngman.

2005-06-24  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* lib/Automake/Variable.pm (define, _new): Remember the helper
	variable created for the last conditional += on each variable, and
	only append further += in the same condition to this last helper
	variable, not to older helper variables.  This way the order of
	the items appended to the variable is preserved.
	* tests/cond21.test: Adjust.
	* tests/cond38.test: New file.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add cond38.test.
	Report from Ed Hartnett.

2005-06-22  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* tests/aclocal5.test: Adjust to recent CVS Autoconf changes.

	* automake.in (handle_footer): Do not output an unformatted
	definition of SOURCES, it is already done correctly in
	generate_makefile.  This superfluous definition introduced long
	lines in some Makefiles, hence breakages in tools with a limited
	line length.  Report from Mathias Froehlich.

2005-06-11  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	* lib/am/texibuild.am (?GENERIC_INFO?%SOURCE_SUFFIX%%DEST_SUFFIX%):

	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add txinfo30.test.
	Report from Bob Proulx.

	* doc/automake.texi (Extending aclocal): Typo.

2005-05-24  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>  (tiny change)

	* lib/am/texinfos.am (.dvi.ps): Add $(am__TEXINFO_TEX_DIR) to TEXINPUTS.

2005-05-15  Alexandre Duret-Lutz  <adl@gnu.org>

	Fix PR automake/461:
	* automake.in (require_build_directory): Canonicalize directories
	with different names, such as `foo/bar' and `./foo//bar'.
	* tests/subobj9.test: Augment to test that.
	Report from Tom Tromey.
